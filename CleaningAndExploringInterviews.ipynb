Going to Atlanta, any reaction?   SHELDEN WILLIAMS:  It feels great.  I mean, Atlanta is not too far from Duke.  I feel truly blessed being in this situation.  I think it's going to be a great experience, and I'm ready to go out there and work right now.    Q.  What was it like sitting in there, everybody else is kind of wondering what's going to happen.  You were the one player that all of the projections seemed to be right, you going to Atlanta.  Did you have a good feeling sitting in there thinking that's where you were going?   SHELDEN WILLIAMS:  I didn't have a good feeling until I found out.  People can say a lot of things, but until your name gets called out, that's the sure thing.  There's no guarantee or anything like that.  Like I said anything can change, last-minute trade and things like that.   I went out there wide-eyed just like everybody else and waited for my name to be called out and fortunately it was called out with Atlanta and I was grateful for that.    Q.  You're going to a very athletic team.  What are you going to bring to the Atlanta Hawks?   SHELDEN WILLIAMS:  Same thing I've done in my four years in college.  I'm a defensive player who is not afraid to bang with other people, being physical.  I'm a rebounder, and also a low-post presence.  That's something I've done in my four years at Duke and something that I will continue to do at the next level with Atlanta.    Q.  You didn't work out for the Hawks.  What do you think you did that caught their eye so dramatically, was it just the body of work you had over your four years at Duke or was it someplace else that they saw you or what?   SHELDEN WILLIAMS:  I'm assuming, you know, just the way I play, the style of play I think is something that I was suitable for the team and they needed somebody who could rebound and be a b banger.  That's something that I fit in pretty well and they had a lot of interest in me and fatally, they drafted me.    Q.  Basically any Duke graduate has their choice of jobs and here you don't have your own choice; is that frustrating?   SHELDEN WILLIAMS:  No, this has been a strange couple of months for me.  I was telling my dad the other day for the first time in my life that I didn't know what I was doing the next day.  I'm pretty much on a schedule the whole course of my life and this is the first time I didn't know what's happening and everything is in the air.   So it's been kind of a crazy kind of few weeks, but I think it's paying off well.    Q.  Atlanta is a very young team.  Do you think you can make a serious impact right away with the Hawks?   SHELDEN WILLIAMS:  I think the things that I provide, I think I'll be able to help and like I said, I'll be a player with lowest-post presence and I can rebound the basketball.  I think I'll be able to contribute pretty quickly.    Q.  You came back for your senior year, does it feel like it's paying off now?   SHELDEN WILLIAMS:  Yeah, I always predicted late in the first round last year one of the main things that brought me back was education.  My family stresses if you start something, you have to finish that.  That's something I kind of weighed heavy on and I wanted to come back and get my degree and finish what I started with the players I came in with, and I think it paid off well, with the relationships that I've built with my teammates and then also moving up in the draft.  I think you know, it's been a great thing for me.  \"}, 'Marcus Williams': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=38453', 'text': \"Q.  How do you feel about dropping, most people expected you to go higher, what are your emotions right now?   MARCUS WILLIAMS:  I'm just happy to be in the situation that I'm in.  What I came through last summer and to now, I think it's just a blessing.  I think me being here, playing behind one of my favorite point guards and watching him while he was in high school in St. Joe's, California, I just think it's a great situation.    Q.  And that's a positive, that you get to learn from the best, Jason Kidd, how does that feel?   MARCUS WILLIAMS:  That's great.  The things he does, I tried to pattern my game after him with the rebounding and passing and just making my teammates better and just playing behind him and learning behind him firsthand, it's great.    Q.  Besides playing with Jason Kidd, you're also going to get a chance to play with your teammate, Josh Boone, tell me how you feel about that?   MARCUS WILLIAMS:  Me and him being on the same team, it's crazy that that happened.  Like I said, everything happens for a reason.    Q.  They say the number isn't as important as the situation; you get into a situation for a playoff team that arguably is maybe one player away; are you that player?   MARCUS WILLIAMS:  Hopefully I can be that player.   You know, Jason Kidd is at the end of his career and I mean, maybe he can't play those minutes.  Who is to say he can and who can say he can't.  I just want to step in and contribute right away.    Q.  You got drafted in this first round, along with your teammates and all that, what does that say about that UConn team this year, even though you guys didn't make the Final Four, but the fact that all four of you guys got drafted in the first round of the NBA draft?   MARCUS WILLIAMS:  Most of the Coach's guys are not guys that's Top-10, top 20, All-American and I think the guys he's put out, he just sees talent.   I think it shows for itself, the coaching staff, him self, the things that he teaches us at school, I think he gets us ready for this level.  (Referring to Coach Calhoun).    Q.  Aside from playing with Jason now and learning from him, you're going to be playing with Vince Carter, can you talk about that and just how you feel about making passes to him and the other guys on that team.   MARCUS WILLIAMS:  You've also got Richard Jefferson.  That's kind of like throwing the two Rudy's.  (Laughter) I think that should be a lot of fun for me and a lot of excitement for the crowd.  And you've already got the excitement from Jason Kidd.   So maybe when he comes out, he won't lose anything.    Q.  Was it weird sitting out there being the only one left of the 15 that were invited?   MARCUS WILLIAMS:  What's that?    Q.  Was it weird being out there as the only one left of the ones that were invited?   MARCUS WILLIAMS:  It was weird, but, I mean, things happen.  Things happen.  I was prepared for it.   I told them, if I'm the last guy out there, so be it.    Q.  Would you call yourself maybe that diamond in the rough, every now and then a player goes late in the draft and all of a sudden he's the main player in the league?   MARCUS WILLIAMS:  I can't say that.  I haven't played a game yet.  But I think my mindset is to be that guy.  I want to step in, contribute, do whatever the team needs me to do.  \"}, 'Tyrus Thomas': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=38440', 'text': \"Q.  Talk to me about, it's been a long evening for you to finally get up here.  Were you sitting backstage waiting to switch the hats?   TYRUS THOMAS:  Yeah, LaMarcus and myself, we were back waiting on a trade to be finalized.  We couldn't move until the trade was finalized so that was about an hour of agony.  We knew where we were going, but we couldn't do anything until the trade got finalized.    Q.  Can you talk about how the trade developed, like when you first heard about it sitting down in the green room and what your reaction was?   TYRUS THOMAS:  Yeah, I knew about the trade before the draft even began.   I guess it was a Chicago wanted to get more assets and Portland wanted to secure LaMarcus from Charlotte.  We both knew about the trade so, it wasn't a shock to me.  I had a heads-up.    Q.  What kind of stuff were you talking about in the back room?   TYRUS THOMAS:  We were just clowning.  We were relaxed, we know where we were going and we're just happy to be here.  We were both just saying how blessed we were to be in this situation and just anxious to get ready on a new career.    Q.  Wondering, how do you see yourself fitting into Chicago, the pieces that they have there, what are you excited about and who are you excited about playing with?   TYRUS THOMAS:  I'm just excited about the whole situation.  You know, I talked to the guys, they know I'm ready to work and they are ready to push me to the limits and help develop me into a better player.  I'm just excited about the process and ready to go to work.    Q.  You've been loose since you arrived in New York, how have you stayed so calm through this?   TYRUS THOMAS:  You've got to understand the situation.  You know, once I got here to New York -- well, actually before then, once my workouts were over, there wasn't much else I could control.  I just wasn't going to put myself under any pressure.  I was going to relax, it's my first time in Chicago, this is my first and last time being in the draft, so I was just going to relax and have a good time.  \"}, 'Cedric Simmons': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=38450', 'text': \"Q.  I guess it must be exciting to go to New Orleans now, your family is probably wishing the Hornets had never left Charlotte?   CEDRIC SIMMONS:  Yeah, I grew up watching the Hornets when I was younger, when they was in Charlotte and then they moved to New Orleans.  Now they are in New Orleans and Oklahoma City.  I've been a Hornets fan for a while.    Q.  Is New Orleans a place that you expected to go coming into the draft?   CEDRIC SIMMONS:  I knew I had a good chance to go there.  We run the same offense at NC State as New Orleans runs also, so I kind of know the offense already.  \"}, 'Saer Sene': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=38446', 'text': \"Q.  There was a lot of attention on the first draft pick who came from Italy.  Can you tell us a little about yourself, from Senegal, and what do you know about Seattle, as well, which obviously is in the Pacific Northwest, any thoughts on this?   SAER SENE:  Say that again?    Q.  Any thoughts on the Pacific Northwest and just being in Seattle?   SAER SENE:  I'm sorry, I don't understand.    Q.  Any thoughts about Seattle, about the City of Seattle and also tell us, in Senegal, this must be a very big event, the fact that you're drafted in the first round of the NBA, this has to be big news back home.   SAER SENE:  It's a good team, I think.   I think they need me and I feel good to go in Seattle.    Q.  Just how excited are you?   SAER SENE:  Yeah, I'm excited.  That's true, I'm here to play, it's okay.  \"}, 'Thabo Sefolosha': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=38449', 'text': \"Q.  What did you feel when you heard your name and you knew you were going to play with Allen Iverson in Philadelphia?   THABO SEFOLOSHA:  First to play with Allen Iverson in Philadelphia, it's a great feeling.  I heard a little bit after that I was going to Chicago.   So I'm happy to go there, and I think it's a great team, with really good talent and a great future, so I'm happy to go there.    Q.  I grew up in northeast Philadelphia.  It's a town that's known for giving its athletes a hard time.  They have a famous line of booing Santa Clause.  It's a tough fan base and media down there.  Is that something that's on your mind and your agent has spoken to you about?   THABO SEFOLOSHA:  Not at all.  I cannot control this.  I just try to give my best on the court and whatever goes around there, I just let it go.    Q.  Who were some of your favorite players when you were growing up, either NBA players or local guys where you lived?   THABO SEFOLOSHA:  Of course, Michael Jordan, and Chris Webber, I liked Chris Webber.  \"}, 'Brandon Roy': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=38442', 'text': \"Q.  So you're a Portland Trail Blazer, two hours from home; what are you going to bring to Portland, a team that probably needs a guy like you?   BRANDON ROY:  Hopefully, you know, I just bring some stability.  I'm going to come in, I played four years in college, they are expecting me to come in and be a leader and work hard.  The biggest thing they wanted me to do was come in and try to lead by example, so that's something I'm going to try to do.    Q.  Trail Blazers have been seriously down in attendance.  How much do you think them drafting you is somewhat of a marketing move to sell some tickets?   BRANDON ROY:  I think that may play a part.   But also, I think they see a chance to maybe get a good player who can play out on the wing and do a number of things on the floor to maybe help them win.  I've played a lot of games in Oregon, so hopefully they don't boo me too bad and hopefully they will be fans of mine now.    Q.  Just to follow-up on that marketing question, they have had some public relations problems with players over the years, I would assume your good guy image has to help.  And also, was this something in the back of your mind, to be able to stay close to home, was it a fantasy in the back of your mind?   BRANDON ROY:  Yeah, going through the process it definitely was a dream of mine to play in Seattle or play close to Portland.  I went to the University of Washington where my family could only drive 20 minutes to games and now they can drive two hours to games.  It makes me comfortable to be able to go out there and compete at my highest level.    Q.  You've been talked about as one of the more NBA-ready players in this draft.  How NBA-ready do you feel?   BRANDON ROY:  I feel good now, but, you know, the NBA is a new game.  It's going to be a new game that I have to get used to playing.  I just want to get in the gym and work hard and try to be able to work up to people's expectations and my own.  \"}, 'J.J. Redick': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=38447', 'text': \"Q.  Talk about going to Orlando.   J.J. REDICK:  Obviously really excited.  This is one of the teams that I circled as a destination that I would really be happy about.   I'm really looking forward to playing with some great young players down there.    Q.  It seemed as if you knew that you were going to be picked by Orlando there.  When did you know; did you suspect they were going to pick you?   J.J. REDICK:  I had a good idea for a few days now, nothing for sure.  And I found out that it was pretty definite on the way over here.    Q.  Obviously very impressive Orlando Magic team.  What are you going to bring to Orlando, and, of course, how is the back?   J.J. REDICK:  Well, first of all, I think I'm going to bring shooting.  I think that's one of the needs that they expressed to me.   And I'm also going to bring some intangibles, just my competitive spirit, my desire to win, all that good stuff.   And as far as the back is concerned, I've been pain-free now for two weeks.  I've gotten very good reports back from my doctors, and if you want, I can bend down and touch my toes for you guys.  (Laughter).    Q.  After all that's been going on the past few weeks; how much of a relief is it to still go this high?   J.J. REDICK:  Oh, I mean, it's a huge relief.  To be honest with you, I kind of had a revelation today before I knew for sure that I was going to Orlando that no matter where I went, you know, it's still a dream come true and not to get caught up in where I was going.   The past few weeks have definitely been a tough time for me.  Some of it I brought on myself, some of it was unfortunate.  I'm sure you guys can figure out which one was which.  I'm just glad to be through this process and start moving on to the next part of my career.    Q.  You went through a very good college career, very good school.  Did it bother you that all of the J.J. Redick stories were either about that incident or health issues, when you do all of this good work and it just seems to come down to this at this point, was it frustrating?   J.J. REDICK:  You know, to be honest with you, the past couple weeks haven't been frustrating because I felt like I brought that upon myself.  A lot of people have written about the DWI and I'm sure fans for a while will make references to that, so I brought that upon myself.   But I felt like even before those incidents happened and my back was hurt, I was getting a lot of negative publicity and most people felt like I wasn't going to be a good pro.  I'm going to use that just like I used all of the criticism I received in my life, just as fuel to add to the fire.    Q.  Now that Grant Hill has been playing for the Orlando Magic the past few years, has he told you anything about playing in the NBA?   J.J. REDICK:  Me and Grant have had several conversations, but to be honest with you, I haven't talked to him since April when I was choosing an agent and I was considering his agent.  I definitely think that's going to be a guy that I lean on early in my career.  That's a great resource that we already have, especially since we already have a relationship.    Q.  It's a young team you're going to Jameer Nelson, Darko; talk about this youth movement, it certainly sounds like a great future?   J.J. REDICK:  Yeah, that's one of the reasons I wanted to go to Orlando was because they had Jameer Nelson and Dwight Howard and Darko.  I feel like as those guys improve and become bonafide superstars in this league, that will only help my game and my improvement.  \"}, 'Oleksiy Pecherov': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=38452', 'text': \"Q.  Oleksiy, talk to me about what do you know about D.C. and the team there?   OLEKSIY PECHEROV:  I saw a couple of the games.  You know, I like the city.

Q.  Who were your favorite players growing up, either where you were or NBA players?   OLEKSIY PECHEROV:  Well, in the NBA, there's so many great players, I'm trying to learn from everybody.  It's what I try to do.   I like Dirk Nowitzki, he's a good player, he's from Europe and he's got the same skills like me.  You know, it's like I think it's a good example for me, how I can play in the future and how I can really work to be a good player.    Q.  Did you pattern your game after him or anyone else that you enjoyed watching?   OLEKSIY PECHEROV:  Yeah, of course, I'm trying.  \"}, \"Patrick O'Bryant\": {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=38445', 'text': \"Q.  Talk to me about Golden State is pretty much an up-and-down team, how are you going to fit in there?   PATRICK O'BRYANT:  You know, I think at Bradley we played kind of an up-and-down style of basketball, so we kind of played that style at Bradley; so that helped me out a lot coming into this draft.  People saw that I can run the floor well and compete in a fast-paced game.    Q.  So what was the highlight of your college career, both regular season and in the tournament, because we know about that big tournament that you had.  Talk about kind of about the regular season and the tournament.   PATRICK O'BRYANT:  Regular season probably was -- yeah, we won at Illinois state, which is our big rival, I-74.  They are only 30 minutes away down Interstate 74, so it was a great win.  It was a packed house there.   So, it was a great rivalry.  So that was really good and I did well in that game.  I had 24, I think, I don't remember exactly.  I had quite a few points and rebounds, so I did well.   Probably the greatest in the tournament was definitely the big game, scoring those 28 points, being the biggest underdog probably in the bracket to win.  So that really made me feel good.    Q.  And you got started playing basketball kind of late, talk about what sports you played before you played ball, if you did play other ones?   PATRICK O'BRYANT:  I started basketball early, actually.  Yeah, I played basketball since I was like seven.    Q.  I thought you had started late?   PATRICK O'BRYANT:  No.    Q.  Who got you started playing?   PATRICK O'BRYANT:  My parents I guess, just said do you want to try out for the little kids team or whatever.  All right, whatever; I didn't know anything.    Q.  And were you good at it right away?   PATRICK O'BRYANT:  Yeah, I think my height helped me.  I've always been taller than people, so, you know, I kind of just was so much taller that nobody can compete with me throughout my elementary school and stuff, so that helped me.  \"}, 'Adam Morrison': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=38439', 'text': \"Q.  Adam, with Michael Jordan having the final say over this pick, what does it mean to you that he would want you?   ADAM MORRISON:  It's great.  I mean, he's the greatest of all time.  You know, I'm just happy to finally get picked.  It's been a long process, but I'm happy where I'm at and looking forward to starting.    Q.  How much of a feel did you have that they were going to take you?   ADAM MORRISON:  You know what, I had kind of a good feeling.  The first workout was real solid.  You know, the talks with my agent, they said they really liked me and so I was just making sure I stayed positive, and it was good.  You know, I didn't really have a feel.  I was just waiting until Mr. Stern said the final deal.    Q.  I heard your agent saying you were very nervous, one of the most nervous on draft night that he had seen.  What was going through your mind and how nervous were you?   ADAM MORRISON:  Obviously this is, you know, a big deal in my life, and all of these players' lives.  This is something we've been working on since you started dreaming about basketball.  I was very nervous, but I feel like this is a perfect fit for me.   You know, Charlotte is a good basketball team, so I'm excited to get there.    Q.  Obviously you had no control over where you were going to be working next year.  How much do you know about the City of Charlotte?  I mean, are you familiar at all with the town, what it has to offer?   ADAM MORRISON:  When I went to the workout, you know, one thing I did notice is there was no traffic and it was quiet and I love it.  So that's one thing I'm very in tune with; I'm very small town-ish I guess you could say.  I like all of the practice facilities and stuff.  It wasn't my choice, just show me where the gym is at, and that's all I need to know.    Q.  Are you disappointed that you didn't end up going No. 1?  Obviously you're happy to be in Charlotte, but do you mind where you got picked?   ADAM MORRISON:  No.  I feel, like I said earlier, I feel like this is a really good fit for me.  So the number really doesn't matter.  I feel like I can help Charlotte, and I just want to be part of a winning organization.  They are on their way to doing that, and so, you know, I'm just excited.  The number wasn't a big deal to me.    Q.  Did you think you might end up in Toronto?   ADAM MORRISON:  Maybe for a second, but when I heard they were going big, there goes my chances.  But that's fine, teams are picking what they need.  It's a business now, so it's good.    Q.  Would you anticipate that maybe you would get some hands-on instruction from Michael Jordan and is that something you would love?   ADAM MORRISON:  Yeah, it would be awesome if I could get some hands-on instruction from Mike.  Any time the greatest player of all time is telling you what to do, if he told me how to tie my shoes a certain way, I would probably listen, or I would listen.  So whatever he's got to say, I'm going to definitely welcome it.  \"}, 'Rudy Gay': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=38444', 'text': \"Q.

RUDY GAY:  You know, personally, you know, I just felt like, you know, kind of let down.  But then again, you know, it's all about right fit.  I feel as though I can be a good fit on any of the teams that I play for.    Q.  Going to Houston, how does that feel?   RUDY GAY:  Honestly, you know, I'm not saying we, because I'm not sure I'm going to play there yet.  But the team, it's a great team.  We have an All-Star in Tracy McGrady, we have Yao Ming who is also an All-Star and you have a lot of great players around him.   I'm just hoping to there and contribute, do what I can.    Q.  In case you end up in Memphis as we all expect, did they work you out at all?  Were you in contact with any of their people?   RUDY GAY:  No, I haven't.  I didn't work out with them at all.  I guess they saw something the other seven teams didn't see.    Q.  What were your thoughts as you watched the picks, 1 through 7 unfold, what was going through your mind?   RUDY GAY:  I was just thinking, you know, hopefully I end up in the right place for me.  And Houston seems like a place that could be a good fit for me, and also Memphis.  I'm pretty happy with the pick.  Although, competitively I am kind of mad that I slipped.    Q.  What is it about the Big East and UConn, what is it about them that produces NBA players?   RUDY GAY:  This is a tough league.  As you can see this year, that expanded, and we didn't lose a step.  Every team is a contender for the NCAA every year, basically.  It's a great league to be in.  I wouldn't change anything for the world, and it definitely made me ready for what I'm about to get into.    Q.  Do you think your game has caught up to your athletic ability yet?   RUDY GAY:  I think, yeah, it has, being that, you know, I've worked on it so much.  I took a lot of time and I used this time to get better as a player.  Too bad you didn't see that during the season, but I think, you know, that's what this was for.   You know, I went to these teams and tried to show them something that I had, and I think that should show them that, you know, I'm trying to be a good player in this league.    Q.  Granted you stay in Houston and you don't move, how exciting would it be to play with Tracy McGrady, one of the best players in the NBA and learning from him?   RUDY GAY:  Learning from him would be great.  Basically I kind of patterned my game after his, I have in the past, and he was definitely a role model for me and a person that I've looked up to.  And you have to, given his play on the court.  He's a great talent and hopefully I'll get to see what type of guy he is.  \"}, 'Randy Foye': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=38443', 'text': 'Q.  So Kevin Garnett, how does that feel?   RANDY FOYE:  Said it right there.  All I know, it\\'s a great feeling when I went there and worked out for Minnesota, he was there.  He watched most of the workout, and I talked to Kevin McHale and when I went there and played, I just impressed them.  I did a lot of things that they probably think that I couldn\\'t do.  So I\\'m just happy to be a Timberwolf right now.    Q.  First of all, congratulations.  What does this moment mean to you, just being up here and talk about how this night went, first from going from being a Celtic to a Portland Trail Blazer to now the Minnesota Timberwolves?   RANDY FOYE:  At first, it was nerve-wracking for me.  I was like, oh, man, like when I see the guys go 1, 2, 3, it was just nerve-wracking.   But then like two picks before, my agent and Brandon\\'s agent was making like eye contact and I didn\\'t know what was going on at the time.  And once I saw my agent\\'s face light up, he was like, \"Yeah, Boston is going to take you.\"    And then, \"Portland is going to take you.\" And then when they said Minnesota, I was like, okay, good, yeah, bring it on.    Q.  Can you look ahead a little bit from what Minnesota has, it seems like a team that you could play for right away, which I know is important to you, as opposed to some other place, a place that you can play?   RANDY FOYE:  Playing right away is not a big concern for me.  I\\'m just willing to go and do anything the team needs me to do.  Just being like a Timberwolf right now is a great feeling for me, just being selected in the NBA draft.    Q.  Minnesota is not exactly known for it\\'s balmy climate in winter.  It makes Philadelphia look like Miami in comparison.  Does that enter to the back of your mind?   RANDY FOYE:  No, that doesn\\'t matter because I\\'m not going to be outside.  I\\'m going to be in the gym.    Q.  Have the Timberwolves talked to you about a 1, a 2, a combo, where they see you?   RANDY FOYE:  When I spoke to Kevin McHale, he was just like, \"I love you because you\\'re a ballplayer.  You can do everything.\" I guess that he saw that from watching film over the course of his last season, and from me working out there.  So I think that he knew what he wanted from day one when I left the workout.    Q.  You played the 1 and the 2 at Villanova.  You\\'re the first point guard taken in the draft; how does that feel and how comfortable do you feel making the point in the NBA?   RANDY FOYE:  If feels great to be the first point guard taken.  That is a lot of pressure.  But if you don\\'t live up to the hype, you know, it doesn\\'t really matter, as long as you just play as hard as you can for your teammates.   What was the second part of your question?    Q.  How comfortable do you feel playing the point?   RANDY FOYE:  I feel real comfortable playing it.  I love when the ball is in my hand at the end of the game.   For me, it\\'s like I look at it as an opportunity to make a play for my teammates or make a play for myself.  So just having the ball at the end of the game, having the ball in my hand over the course of a game is just like a great feeling.

How do you see yourself fitting in with guys like Iverson and Igoudala?   RODNEY CARNEY:  Well, he scores a lot and even if he's double-teamed I'm able to knock down the 3-point shot so he and Igoudala can run the wings and we have the option to throw the lob, too.  With the fast break option, they are going to have to kill me, too.    Q.  Did you have any inkling this was going to happen with the 76ers and what was your reaction?   RODNEY CARNEY:  I had none.  I thought actually when I went to work out with them I had an injury and I wouldn't work out, it was just an interview.   This is going to be a great opportunity to play for the Philadelphia 76ers.    Q.  What do you think about your attributes, your personality you'll bring?   RODNEY CARNEY:  Off the court, I'm a good guy.  In Memphis, we went and helped the kids a lot in the school system, we had tournaments for them, we did all we could for them in the school system, for the public and the community.  It's going to be a real good fit for me there.    Q.  Last season the Philadelphia 76ers had problems with defense and rebounding.  Is that a strong part of your game, is that something that you can bring to the table as well?   RODNEY CARNEY:  Well, rebounding I can get a little better on.  Defensively I can be a knock down, defend as people have seen during the season.  They see me when I guarded J.J. and I did a great job on him and other players.  They probably seen that and that's why they got me.  \"}, 'Andrea Bargnani': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=38437', 'text': \"Q.  Congratulations.

I feel so excited, so proud to represent my country.  It's an incredible sensation, I cannot describe in words.  It's incredible.    Q.  Back home do you think this might knock the World Cup off the front page of the sports pages in Italy?   ANDREA BARGNANI:  Yeah, I hope, in Italy, all of the attention is for the soccer.   Tomorrow, I hope there's a little picture.    Q.  What is your game going to bring to the Toronto Raptors?  What's your style of play?   ANDREA BARGNANI:  I hope to help the team as soon as possible.  I'm a young player, I know that I will find a lot of tough moments because it's a new league and I'm used to playing in Europe.  So it's a new experience, and I have to work a lot.   But I'm ready for this.  I repeat, I will find a lot of tough moments, but I'm ready for this.    Q.  How confident were you that you would be the No. 1 pick?   ANDREA BARGNANI:  How confident?  No. 1 is an incredible -- I tell you, I cannot describe the sensation.  It's incredible.  I have no words.  (Smiling) I cannot describe because I am not able to describe in English well.    Q.  Did you think you were going to be picked No. 1, did you know you were going to be picked No. 1?   ANDREA BARGNANI:  No, I had no idea, no idea.  No, nobody told me nothing before the draft.  Just more or less the position between 1 and 7, 1 and 8.  But it was a surprise.    Q.  How do you feel about the prospect of living and playing in Toronto?   ANDREA BARGNANI:  Very good, because I went to Toronto two years ago.  It's a very nice city.  I know that there is a big Italian community in Toronto, so it's very nice.  I think Toronto also is an incredible organization, so I'm very happy.  \"}, 'Hilton Armstrong': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=38448', 'text': \"Q.  Have you seen New Orleans play at all last year, any impressions of them?   HILTON ARMSTRONG:  Seen a little bit, especially with Chris Paul, he's helped the team out a lot.  He's a great player and I think he can make me a better player.    Q.  You showed a lot of emotion when Rudy got drafted.  What was going through your minds in that situation?   HILTON ARMSTRONG:  He's a UCONN player.  He's like one of my brothers.  I've been with him for two years and every day, you see him every day, even over the summer we keep in contact.   To see him drafted just made me feel good.    Q.  Emeka Okafor is a UCONN guy, he's a pretty sharp guy, did he leave an impression?  I'm sure you chatted with him about the importance of scholarship at the college, as well as basketball skills; did that leave an impression on you?   HILTON ARMSTRONG:  Yeah, definitely.  He leads by example.  He was always a hard worker off the court also.  At school, he always had a book in his hand and always studying and trying to keep everybody eligible so they could do their best.    Q.  Talk about your game and how NBA-ready you are right now and what skills and will it take a while to adjust?   HILTON ARMSTRONG:  I can get better in every aspect of my game.   Right now, I think I do pretty good with defense, shot-blocking and I have an offensive game that a lot of people don't know about.

Q.  So when exactly did you get the heads-up?   LaMARCUS ALDRIDGE:  Right before they said my name.  They said, \"They are going to call your name in a minute, but don\\'t worry about it, they are going to trade you.\"    Q.  How excited are you to be entering the league?

NICK YOUNG:  I'm going to let him show me a lot.  I could teach him my fadeaway.  (Laughter).    Q.  How good does it feel to be in a situation like with the Wizards where they have made the playoffs the past few years and you are not going to be going into a rebuilding situation?   NICK YOUNG:  It's a great feeling just to be drafted.  Going to a team like Washington is great.   I watched them over the past years and I watched what Gilbert did to the Lakers, so it's a great feeling going there.    Q.  You grew up in the San Fernando Valley and went to school in downtown Los Angeles, a little nerve-wracking coming 3,000 miles across the country on your own?   NICK YOUNG:  Yeah, but me and Gilbert come from the same area so he'll show me the ropes.  I'm just glad to be in this situation and it's a blessing.    Q.  It's been a very big year for you, documentary film coming out about you; how does it feel as a culmination of your year?   NICK YOUNG:  You know, this is great.

I'm excited to get to play the best type of ball that you can play, spread it out, one-on-one, make a lot of plays and show what you can do.    Q.  How is it going to feel to go from one side of the country to the other?   BRANDAN WRIGHT:  Flying all the way across the country it's going to be an adjustment.

So you get to play with Chris Paul; can you talk about playing with a great young point guard like that?   JULIAN WRIGHT:  I'm definitely excited.  I look forward to playing with Chris Paul.  He's a good player, a good person, and you know, I don't personally know him but he has a really good vibe with everyone and makes everyone play better.   I just really look forward to it.    Q.  How much do you know about the New Orleans franchise going in; did you meet with the team or anything like that?   JULIAN WRIGHT:  I didn't schedule a work-out but my agent has really good relations with the team and that really is a plus with this whole process and I'm really blessed to have an agent that really has my back in this whole thing.    Q.  Do you want to talk about your Kansas legacy, about other Kansas players and stuff like that?   JULIAN WRIGHT:  I'm just happy firstly to be in this situation and hopefully be a guy that maybe guys can come there in the future, can look up to and hopefully I can set a good example and just be a hard worker and improve and just really flourish and hold it down for the Kansas alums.    Q.  What did you think about this whole process, declaring early, the workouts, being in the Green Room for longer than most of the guys in there; what was it like?   JULIAN WRIGHT:  Oh, you mean like -- I felt pretty composed.  This was a good draft.  Anything was possible at this draft, fortunately and unfortunately.  I was fortunate enough to be on that side where I was trying to work at Top-10 teams but we knew going into this, there's so many great players, potential great players, so I'm really happy to be picked where I'm at.    Q.  Coming from such a good program like Kansas and such a good core team, how tough of a decision was it for you to make this jump to go to the next level?   JULIAN WRIGHT:  It was a tough, tough decision.  I think it's tough on anyone, even if, you know, a guy like Greg Oden to come here, it's tough when you're at these schools with lots of tradition, it makes it hard and tough.  You really have great experiences there.   Like I said, I'm fortunate to be in this situation and going to make the most of it.  Definitely I will keep in contact with everybody that has helped me with this process and that I've had their support so I'm grateful for that.    Q.  Obviously it's two years out since Hurricane Katrina; are you curious, have you been to New Orleans, or do you see yourself playing a role in the city's further recovery?   JULIAN WRIGHT:  I definitely thought about that.  The NBA, it's a job and you're playing, but we definitely have a social responsibility to really help the community.  So I'm really looking forward to that, as well.  I have never had the time to just travel to New Orleans and see how it is now, but I heard it's improving with a lot of good players and good people in the community and hopefully I can be a role model in that respect.    Q.  There were three or four teams; Charlotte, Chicago, Sacramento; that maybe you might have gone to and went by; did that start to make you nervous at that point when those teams passed up on you?   JULIAN WRIGHT:  No.  I appreciate the honesty of teams.  Going through this with my agent, we were talking about the workouts and just trying to alleviate a lot of the anxiety, we would ask how high I was on their list or they would give options, certain guys on the list and that makes it obvious.  It's a deep draft and I respect that and in these workouts I tried to work as hard as I could and let things fall where it did.  Like I said, I'm happy to be where I'm at.    Q.  You're going to play with Chris Paul, but more importantly for Coach Scott, he's tough on rookies; have you spoken to him?   JULIAN WRIGHT:  I haven't spoken to him yet.  I'm happy and fortunate to have really great coaches, my high school coach is a Hall of Famer in Illinois, and soon-to-be Hall of Famer in coach Bill Self.   I just know the experiences with my head coaches in the past, they were tough on me but that really helps me and that helps me to be in this situation now.  \"}, 'Al Thornton': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=43866', 'text': \"Q.

At what point did you think that the Clippers were a really legitimate possibility to take you, or were you looking at other teams?  What kind of feedback were you getting?   AL THORNTON:  You know what, I really didn't know.  I thought I was between the 7 and 12 range, but sometime you never know.  You never know with the Draft.   Like I said, I think the Clippers, they are a great fit for me.  They have an open offense and they have some veterans and they have some young players and they are an up-tempo team and I think that's a great fit to showcase my skills.    Q.  You're going out to the Clippers and arguably they were a team last year that was in the playoffs maybe a player away; are you that player?   AL THORNTON:  I think I can be.

They need another young point guard and I'm willing to step in that position and help Billups and Rip however I can, setting up the offense, doing whatever I can.    Q.  Can you talk about learning from those players, the success they have had and all of the attention the backcourt has got over the years?   RODNEY STUCKEY:  They have been successful and they have been to the Eastern Conference Finals for the last five or six years.   I'm just trying to keep leading them there and we'll see what happens.    Q.  Did you have a favorite team growing up?   RODNEY STUCKEY:  No.  I watched the NBA a lot but I really didn't have a favorite NBA team.    Q.  Obviously the Pistons were a few games away from NBA Finals, but now they are a team very much in transition.  How are you going to help them bridge that gap to help bring them back to the team that got over the hump and make it to the Finals?   RODNEY STUCKEY:  I thought they should have made it The Finals.  You know, the games didn't just go their way.  But I'm willing to do anything to help them get through that, like I said.  And, man, I don't know, I can't really say how I feel right now, I'm just so excited.    Q.  Joe Dumars said he wanted to find place to put a guy like you --   RODNEY STUCKEY:  Oh, yeah, I have something to prove.  Me and Joe Dumars have like similar background.  We came from small schools, you know.  So I mean, I think I do have something to prove.  Not a lot of people really know who I am, and you know, I'm willing when I get my chance, I'm going to show people who I am and I'm willing to work and I'm going to work hard every day.    Q.  Did the Pistons give you any indication they were leading towards you; when did you know you were going to be a Piston?   RODNEY STUCKEY:  They always liked me.  I mean, probably majority of my games they were at, you know, they were asking for game film constantly and stuff.  That kind of gave me a good idea they were leaning towards me.  I'm just excited to go to Detroit.  This is probably one of the teams I would love to go to, you know what I mean, because they have a really good group of guys.    Q.  The Pistons have a reputation based on their defense but you're known for scoring; what do you think about their style?   RODNEY STUCKEY:  Offensively, I don't really have to worry about that.  Just learning how to play, getting to the NBA, I'm going to have to learn and it's going to take practice and I will get better.    Q.  I always thought that Gonzaga is the small basketball school in Washington State.  How did you pick Eastern Washington over Gonzaga?   RODNEY STUCKEY:  Coming out of high school I didn't qualify, I was a couple credits short.  Eastern Washington had this program called prop 48 where you could go to school for a year and just work on your academics and that's what I did.  \"}, 'Gabe Pruitt': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=43873', 'text': \"Q.

So they had had no contact with you?   GABE PRUITT:  No contact, no.    Q.  You're getting an opportunity to play with both Paul Pierce and now Ray Allen, can you tell me what you think about getting knowledge from these two All-Stars?   GABE PRUITT:  I think it will be a good learning process for me.  Paul Pierce is a West Coast guy so I see him a lot in L.A.  Ray Allen I watched a lot growing up.   So for me to pick up from those two guys and learning from them, I think that will help me out a lot.    Q.  Obviously you came from southern California, very popular basketball place, but Boston is a very rabid basketball fan base; are you ready to deal with that?   GABE PRUITT:  I am.  I'm ready to deal with any environment.  It will be new to come to the East Coast and play for a team, but this is my life now and I have to make it happen.    Q.  With all of the trades that are going to go on today, do you feel like there's maybe more pressure for you now; that this is going to be a team that's expected to make the playoffs next year?   GABE PRUITT:  Maybe.  With the trade with Ray Allen and we have Paul Pierce now and the guys they have on their team, you know, it could be possible.  But you know, I do good with pressure and I just have to work that much harder to make this team better.    Q.  Were you in any way, shape or form promised or given any kind of indication that you probably were going to be a first-round pick from somebody?  Because we had heard that; did you hear that?   GABE PRUITT:  Yeah, coming up to this day, Detroit, that was a team I thought I was going to at 27.  I thought I was going to go there but things didn't work out, something happened and they took my good friend Arron.   After that I was pretty much -- I didn't know exactly what was going on, so I was just sitting here waiting patiently.    Q.  Now that you've been through the process and here at draft night, take me through how you're feeling and now that this is all said and done, you're heading to Boston?   GABE PRUITT:  It's a big relief that I've been selected now.  It's a long waiting process.  Just going through this was new to me and my family and going through this whole process, learned a lot of new things and met a lot of great people.  I don't regret any of it.    Q.  You mentioned Paul Pierce before; do you actually know him?   GABE PRUITT:  No, I've never spoken with Paul Pierce.  But I've seen him around, played with him a couple of times.  But I don't know him too well.  You know, I'm sure in the next couple of days I'll get to know him very well and meet him and have a couple of talks with him.    Q.  Where have you played with him?

Greg, just a quick question, big man, obviously a big part of your game is going to be who sets you up.  Talk about playing with Brandon Roy.  Have you had a chance to talk with him and are you excited about that combination?   GREG ODEN:  Yes, I had a chance to talk to him and actually when I was in Seattle I texted him a little bit because he\\'s from Seattle.   I\\'ve seen a couple highlights of him.  He\\'s pretty good, pretty decent.   But to have somebody like him and all of the other guys, Rodriguez and Jarrett Jack and Fred Jones and all of those guys throwing passes to me, that will be nice.    Q.  Can you speak with Phil Knight?  And when you signed an endorsement deal with Nike was it in anticipation of being with Portland?   GREG ODEN:  That could have helped.  Could have happened.  Thank you if it did.  But I did get to see him when I was there at Nike.  He was strolling by us in Nike\\'s.  He\\'s a cool guy.    Q.  How old were you when you first started thinking about being the No. 1 draft pick, and how important was it to you?   GREG ODEN:  When I first started thinking about it was really after last season.  I know a lot of people talked to me about it; said that whenever you leave, you\\'ll be No. 1.  But really I knew myself that I wanted to go to college and I wanted to be ready when I left.  So actually after the season -- well, about two weeks after, that\\'s the break I took after the season.  But two weeks after is when I really started giving it thought.    Q.  What made you think that you were ready for the NBA?   GREG ODEN:  Me coming in, I didn\\'t think we would be able to accomplish what we did, especially in college being able to make it to the National Championship and me to have a decent season like I did.  I didn\\'t think I was ready for that.  I wasn\\'t sure if I was ready for that.   But when I came in and we did it, it was like, well, I know I can improve because I\\'ve been playing with 50 percent because I didn\\'t have my right hand the whole entire year.  So I know I can improve.   I think the next level is going to be really difficult, but I think as long as I improve and just keep working hard, I can play pretty well.    Q.  The Blazers have had some tough times the last few years and had some difficulties on and off the court; how ready are you to try to help turn that around, along with LaMarcus and Brandon?   GREG ODEN:  Well, I have 1:30 bed time limit, so I won\\'t be out at night.  (Laughter).   Just all of those guys, those are great guys.  Just being around those guys, they are all great people, and they did have a bad represent, but I think Brandon and LaMarcus kind of turned that around and I hope that I can come and just push that along some more.    Q.  Leading up to the Draft, all of the talk was about you and Kevin and who would go first; now you\\'re in neighboring states and in the same division; how long do you think all of that talk will continue?   GREG ODEN:  As long as we\\'re both in the same league; I hope.   I know we\\'re going to be connected for a long time.  Kevin Durant, Greg Oden. (Laughter).   He\\'s a really, really good player.  I\\'m a pretty decent player.  So I hope things work out.  I would love to get way more championships than him.  He\\'s coming, but he\\'s not here yet, so he didn\\'t hear me.    Q.  First of all, who were you on the phone with when you came in, and second of all, what was the, what did the Commissioner say to you when you got up there?   GREG ODEN:  He said, \"Everything is about to slow down now.  Just enjoy this for next 24 hours and look out there and smile and then go follow her.\"  (Laughter) That\\'s what he said.   I was on the phone with the radio station back in Portland.  They said they stumped the floor like they won the NBA championship once they called my name.    Q.  Any regrets about leaving the collegiate experience?   GREG ODEN:  Well, it was way more than enjoy; everyone who is here knows, going to college, that first year, it\\'s the greatest thing ever.  So that\\'s what I went through.  I had the greatest year of my life.   And just leaving Columbus is great and I loved being there, and it\\'s hard to leave.    Q.  Are you going to go back?   GREG ODEN:  I\\'m definitely going to go back.  I\\'ve got David there, I\\'ve definitely got to go see him.    Q.  What about your degree?   GREG ODEN:  Oh, we already have plans of me doing that.  I don\\'t know exactly when, but I do have plans to get the Ohio State University degree.    Q.  We know you know plenty about basketball and you have four or five endorsements already.  What have you learned about the marketing game?   GREG ODEN:  Oh, you try to throw some big stuff at me.   I know this first and foremost, you\\'ve got to know people.  If you know big people, then good things will happen.  So what I did is instead of meeting people up here and moving up; they started me up and I\\'m moving down.   So already, if I meet somebody and they want to do something and it\\'s like, well, maybe not, then the big guy is like you know what, I just met him, he\\'s a great guy, we\\'re going to do it.   That\\'s how I run, I start from the top and go down to the bottom.    Q.  This week has been rough on you with your scheduling; you caught a cold.  Just talk about this week and now that it\\'s over, what do you plan on doing now that you know what your future is like?   GREG ODEN:  I think I get like two days to relax before I have to start practicing for Summer League.  Hopefully I get to go back and pack, because I think I get picked out of my apartment the 6th and I don\\'t think they want to throw my stuff out, just saying.    Q.  Does this take any of the sting away from that Monday night game back in April against Florida?   GREG ODEN:  No.  Not at all.  I still lost.  They still won two National Championships in a row, and that doesn\\'t change.   This feels good, but it\\'s two different categories.  I\\'m always going to have that memory of that loss forever.  '}, 'Joakim Noah': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=43875', 'text': \"Q.  In the National Championship game, you look at it, there were five guys on the court who were the first nine picks in this draft.  Did you appreciate then the talent that was out there that night?   JOAKIM NOAH:  Yeah, I mean, do I appreciate it?  I appreciate that we won the game more, though.  (Laughter).    Q.  How does it feel to be one of three Gators in the first nine?  What does that say about Florida basketball?   JOAKIM NOAH:  It means a lot.  I mean, I'm really proud of my teammates.  I mean, it's just such an exciting time for all of us right now, and I just hope that Taurean Green and the rest of the crew, they have a chance to get drafted, too.   I mean, you know, I'm in a loss of words right now.  I'm playing for an organization that I really wanted to play for.  I look at the Top-10 and I feel like Chicago definitely is one of the only teams that really has a chance to be a contender to win a championship; and to be a part of that right away and to learn from great players like Ben Wallace and Ty Thomas and the great backcourt that they have with Ben Gordon and Kirk Hinrich, I'm just so excited right now.  I feel very fortunate and very blessed.    Q.  Did you see Chicago play at all last year on television?   JOAKIM NOAH:  Yeah, I seen Chicago play a little bit.  Not too much.  I actually like watching the college games better than the NBA games.  (Sighing) Wow.  I'm going to the League, man.   He was my coach in like tenth grade (pointing to gentleman in audience. ) This is crazy.  Ask him if he thought I would be here with a Chicago Bulls hat.  If he says yes, he's lying.  He didn't even start me.    Q.  What made you go with the bow tie tonight?  Going against the trend.   JOAKIM NOAH:  A funky look, isn't it.    Q.  I like it.    JOAKIM NOAH:  Thanks a lot.  You know, I'm going to be me.  I'm going to be me.  I think that the bow tie was definitely a great look tonight.  I think the suit was really, really funky.  I said it was going to be funky.  I've got a lot of love so far from the suit.  I'm just happy, man.   I feel really lucky, like I worked really hard for this, but at the same time, like I'm just a really lucky guy right now.  I really feel like the luckiest man in the world.  I had the best college experience, ever.  I don't know if there's anybody in the world who had a better college experience than me, ever, like the No. 1 best college experience, ever.   And now I get a chance to play in the NBA.  I might be considered for one of the luckiest people in the world, for real.    Q.  What was going through your mind as the draft unfolded, and how did you feel when the Chicago pick was coming up?  Did you feel confident?   JOAKIM NOAH:  That was the longest hour of my life.  I mean, I'm really happy for Al and Corey, but especially Corey, because Corey was sitting right next to me.  So when he wasn't there and I couldn't joke around with him, those minutes felt so long.   Like I'm really happy for those guys.  I feel like -- I just feel like just the opportunity that I have right now is just unbelievable, and I'm really, really fortunate for that.    Q.  You won two titles at Florida.  Do you think you'll be able to win any titles like soon with Chicago?   JOAKIM NOAH:  That's definitely the plan.  I think that Chicago has -- the Chicago Bulls have a lot of tradition.  They are a team that isn't satisfied unless they win the Championship, because I think that the city expects the championship because they won six in a ten-year span.   I mean, it's just -- growing up I was actually a Knicks fan and the Bulls used to make me cry as a kid.  And how ironic is it, now I'm wearing a Bulls hat, and I've never been so happy in my life.    Q.  You're going to Chicago, large market; how much more marketable do you feel for the shoe companies and/or the hair companies or anything else?   JOAKIM NOAH:  Oh, I feel so marketable, you have no idea.  I'm so marketable; yes.  That's exactly why I wanted to go to Chicago; to be marketable.  (Laughter).    Q.  Last year there was a Swiss guy (Thabo Sefolosha) who joined the Bulls; do you know him or have you ever met him?   JOAKIM NOAH:  No.    Q.  Never met him?   JOAKIM NOAH:  I will soon.  Is he still there?    Q.  Yeah.   JOAKIM NOAH:  I can't wait to see him.  He's my teammate.  That's my teammate.    Q.  Certainly coming from a sports family, was it a big advantage to be in a big city like Chicago?  There are certain lucrative endorsement opportunities that the other eight picks will not have.   JOAKIM NOAH:  Like I said, I'm very lucky.   But to me, it's more about winning.  I went to school in Gainesville, a small town.  I've always been from the big city.  I lived ten years in Paris, France.  I lived the rest of my life in New York City.  But I feel like Gainesville was a small town and I had a great three years over there and memories that I'll never forget.   To me, you guys look at it as market and it's always about money and this and, oh, if I would have went last year, then would I have been a higher pick and it's money and money and you're talking about money.   But to me, I feel like it's happiness.  It's about being happy and winning makes me happy.  I feel like I have an opportunity to win a lot of basketball games in Chicago, and to me, that's what's more important is the winning aspect of it.    Q.  How you feeling?   JOAKIM NOAH:  You already know, man.  My life is like a movie, for real.    Q.  At what point do you think you're going to emotionally accept that you're now an NBA player; it's official; it's done?   JOAKIM NOAH:  Oh, trust me.  I feel like an NBA player right now.   You'll see me tonight when I walk out the Garden, my swag will be of an NBA player.    Q.  When you got picked, Corey was doing an interview on the radio and he stopped the interview and stood up and raised his hands and started doing the Gator chop; can you talk about what this means for the University of Florida tonight.   JOAKIM NOAH:  I think that the University is very proud of us, not just like the college itself, but the students and the alumni and everything else.  That's one thing that I realize about the south and the Southeastern Conference and just southern schools in general; they wear those colors with so much pride, and I think more than up north.  I'm not trying to make a knock or anything or knock the schools up north or anything, but I think that in the south, it's like a way of life.   And when you wear those Gator colors, they want you to wear them proudly.  And I think that we represented the school really well by -- we were ourselves, though.  We weren't hiding.  I think that people saw that we weren't scared to show our emotions.  We weren't scared to show our character.  And I think that, you know, the people at Florida, they saw that and they appreciated what we did.   And then of course when you win, too, that of course helps when you win games, because it makes everybody happy.  And it wasn't just the University; it was the town of Gainesville.  People really appreciate what we did.  To me, I'll always be a Gator in my heart.  I'm not taking anything for granted, but I know I had the three best years of my life, so far; like so far they have been -- I think it can still get better.  But I think that I had an unbelievable experience over there.    Q.  You were talking about being a Knicks fan growing up; is there any sort of bittersweet feeling because this was the Knicks pick originally?   JOAKIM NOAH:  I can't.  I can't right now.  Bittersweet?  It's all sweet, like the sweetest candy ever.  Like I'm so happy.  Like I couldn't be any happier.  I feel like, it's undescribable.  Just the opportunity that I have and the situation that was just handed to me is just -- thank you Mr. Paxson.  I used to really not like you when you were a player because you used to make me cry.  But thank you so much.   I told him that on my interview, too.  Thank you so much.  \"}, 'Acie Law IV': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=43865', 'text': \"Q.  I read that Ernie Banks is your uncle.  Did you inherit his sunny disposition and did that help you in this Draft craziness?   ACIE LAW IV:  We have an okay relationship.  We speak probably a couple times a year.  He's been a guy that I've looked up to and I've seen things that he's done with his career and felt like I could be successful as he was.  He's a great guy and I'm glad to see he's a part of my family.    Q.  In college, you were known as a guy who took over games and brought the team to a different level; are you going to interject that in your rookie year to Atlanta?   ACIE LAW IV:  I've just got to do whatever it takes for us to win.  Just be aggressive and make plays for the guys that, what I'm going to do, I just want the clock to run out and know that our team is ahead and that we've got the W, that's all that matters.    Q.  When did you know Atlanta was going to take you?  There was a lot of speculation after a work-out that you were shutting it down and that they were making a guarantee.  When did you know?   ACIE LAW IV:  I think I knew about pick No. 9.  (Laughter).   No, last night, I couldn't sleep.  I didn't go to sleep until about 4:00 AM, and this morning, all throughout the day, I've been nervous.  Guys I've been here with have been telling me, you're going to be okay, but it's a nerve-wracking experience and your life is about to change.  When I found out at pick No. 9 or 10 that they were going to take me, it was a big relief and I was excited I was going to accomplish something that I wanted to accomplish since I was a kid and that's play in the NBA.    Q.  With all of the talk about this Draft being about freshmen, with you being the first senior, what statement does that make?   ACIE LAW IV:  Freshmen are very, very talented.  I think in the Draft, it's all about position and what a team needs, and you see some great, great players in this draft.   I'm happy with the team that I went to and just happy to get to Atlanta and help turn that franchise around.    Q.  Given that you stayed four years, does that also send a message to go as high as you did and complete four years of school?   ACIE LAW IV:  I always said that different guys, different players are presented with different situations.  I mean some, guys are fortunate enough to be ready to come out after the first of the season and I didn't feel like I was ready after my sophomore or junior season and I wanted to develop my game while I was in college and that's why I decided to stay.   That's the decision I made and I'm glad, it was a good decision.    Q.  I saw that you majored in agricultural leadership.  Since we are here in the big city, that's foreign to us.   ACIE LAW IV:  It's a wide open field.  You pretty much can get into anything you want to with that major.    Q.  Do you deal with earth science and things along that line?   ACIE LAW IV:  Yeah.    Q.  I was wondering what you're going to do after signing your first contract; how are you going to spoil yourself a little bit?   ACIE LAW IV:  I'm going to buy myself a house, give myself somewhere to stay.  I've already purchased my mom a car.  I bought her a Lexus.   So just going to try to get me a house and get me a nice, comfortable place to stay in Atlanta and just looking forward to turning that franchise around.  \"}, 'Petteri Koponen': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=43881', 'text': \"Q.  I'm curious to know how much you know about the Philadelphia 76ers.   PETTERI KOPONEN  :  Well, I know that Allen Iverson was there and he played pretty good there.  Now they traded him to the Denver Nuggets.   I'm actually very excited to go to Philadelphia and play there.    Q.  What basketball players in the NBA did you grow up idolizing?   PETTERI KOPONEN:  I can say Steve Nash.  I watched lots of games from him and Jason Kidd.  I watched them and tried to learn something from them.   But right now Steve Nash I can say is my idol.    Q.  Do you know anything about the current 76ers roster, for instance, Iguodala, very good jumper and very athletic; do you know anything about him?   PETTERI KOPONEN:  Yes, he's a very good athlete and they have Kyle Korver, a very good shooter.  That's what I know.    Q.  What is your contract status?

Chinese players in the NBA at this moment, there are not that many.   I'm looking forward to playing with him on the court, and it will be fun to play with him in the NBA.    Q.  Do you know him?  Have you met before?   YI JIANLIAN:  I didn't play with Yao Ming in the Chinese League, the CBA in China.  But we played together for the national team so we are teammates.    Q.  Now you've been picked as the sixth draft pick with Milwaukee; the Chinese media feel this is a surprise.  How do you feel about that?   YI JIANLIAN:  It's a surprise to me, as well, because when I was in China, Milwaukee didn't come to watch me play or to work out.   Myself, I'm not really familiar with the city, as well, but I'm happy to play with the team and I'm happy to play in the NBA.    Q.  Do you know anything about the Milwaukee team, and why didn't you work out for them leading up to the Draft?   YI JIANLIAN:  I don't know much about the team because in China, their games -- I didn't see a lot of games of Milwaukee in China.   And I've never been there, so it's kind of a new city to me.    Q.  First, can you tell us, are you for sure going to go to Milwaukee to play?  And secondly, on the stage you were chit-catting with Oden on the stage; what were you guys talking about?   YI JIANLIAN:  The first question, yes, I think so.   The second question, Oden is a good guy, a funny guy.    Q.  Two questions.  First, when the third pick and the fifth pick were announced, what were you thinking about; did anything go through your mind?  And secondly, I know you definitely have a preference of which team you favored; what was your expectation in this draft?   YI JIANLIAN:  The Draft is just like a lottery to me.  To be honest with you, I had no idea, and lots of trades were going on.  Lots of scenarios were happening, so at that moment, I didn't think much about it.  \"}, 'Al Horford': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=43864', 'text': \"Q.

You know, winning two national championships at Florida and then moving up to the next level and being fortunate enough to get picked third overall; it's something very special.    Q.  When did you know?  Did you know before the Draft today that you were going to be third?   AL HORFORD:  I didn't want anyone to tell me anything.  I didn't know what was going to happen.  I felt like my agent, he had a good idea, but I just wanted to wait and see what happened.    Q.  What do you think about going to Atlanta, how young they are and how you fit into that mix there?   AL HORFORD:  Well, I'm excited about it, man.  You've got a lot of young, talented guys and I feel like I can come in and help the team around right away.   We've got to turn this thing around and get it going.    Q.  After tonight, you Joakim and Corey have been together for so long and now you'll be going your separate ways; what do you anticipate that being like?   AL HORFORD:  It's going to be different.  Obviously at this time in Florida, we're out on summer break and we're starting to come back to go to summer School.  Obviously it's a little different now.  We're going to separate teams.   It's a new beginning for us, and we're excited about it.  We had a great time at Florida, but I think it's time to move on to bigger things.    Q.  What do you think of the whole Billy Donovan scenario; did he speak with you after all of this happened?   AL HORFORD:  I got a chance to talk to coach.  I feel like everyone makes mistakes and fortunately, you know, I think he chose happiness and I think he felt like Florida was the place for him.  So it was a good decision for him and I'm happy for him.    Q.  I was wondering, what's the first thing you're going to buy or do after you sign your first contract?   AL HORFORD:  I probably -- I don't know.  I'll probably get a car, a nice car.  That will be the first big purchase that I make.    Q.  Any car in particular?   AL HORFORD:  Range Rover.  I'm not going to tell you the color because, you know, then people start feeling it and they want to start getting it in that color.    Q.  Red?   AL HORFORD:  No, no, it's different.  No red.    Q.  How does this compare and contrast to winning National Championships, is this a better feeling?  Is it a different feeling?   AL HORFORD:  It's a different feeling.  Winning a National Championship is something really special.  I don't think there's not a lot of things that compare to that, unless you win an NBA championship or another major title like that.  This is just the start of my career in the NBA.   Definitely winning a National Championship is something very special.    Q.  Tito was waving the Dominican flag; is this a good day for the Dominican Republic considering how high you were drafted?   AL HORFORD:  We're proud of where we're from and he just got a little carried away with the flag.  It's all good.   It's a good day.  I feel like basketball is going over there.

SPENCER HAWES:  No, I think he's doing what he needs to do.  I think especially in a state like that, you can't get away with that in other places.    Q.  Going out to the Sacramento Kings, they are probably in a rebuilding mode playing with a guy like Kevin Martin; what are you looking forward to in Sacramento?   SPENCER HAWES:  I think it's going to be a great opportunity with the talent that's in place to improve.  I'm looking forward to playing with Coach Reggie Theus, I've been paying attention to him and what he's done for a while.   So it's going to be a great opportunity for me.  I'm thrilled.    Q.  Are you excited to stay on the West Coast and stay closer to home?

Jeff, can you talk about your thoughts on this trade, linking up with Kevin out there and just how that whole deal feels to you right now?   JEFF GREEN:  Well, first, it was long.  I was waiting as soon as I\\'ve been picked.   I\\'m happy it happened but I had no control over it.  I\\'m happy to be in Seattle with Kevin.  I know it\\'s going to be a great fit and a lot of young players, so I\\'m looking forward to it.    Q.  Could you just talk about your relationship with Kevin?  I know you said you were good friends but yesterday you said you had not played with him?   JEFF GREEN:  Yeah, and now I\\'ve got the chance to play with him.   I\\'ve known him since I was younger, played on the D.C. Blue Devils.  I never got the chance to play with him but now I do and it\\'s under the NBA microscope.  It\\'s going to be fun.  Looking forward to it and he\\'s a great talent.  Just to connect with Wilcox who is already on the team, it\\'s going to be a fun upcoming season.    Q.  Did you know Delonte at all?   JEFF GREEN:  No, I did not.  I know he went to Roosevelt; a lot of Maryland players are going to be on this team.    Q.  Do you think that will make the transition easier, being so far from home?   JEFF GREEN:  Yeah, him being from the Maryland area, going to Roosevelt which is like five minutes from where I live and him being in the NBA for awhile, he can really help me and Kevin out and show us the ropes.    Q.  With Kevin playing the 3 and you playing the 3 and Rashard potentially coming back, how do you see yourself matching when you\\'re playing the same position?   JEFF GREEN:  Yeah, we\\'re going to be tough to guard, three 6\\'9\" guys who can do everything; shoot, pass, defend; it\\'s going to be tough for teams to defend.  It\\'s going to make things easier for each other so I\\'m really looking forward to it.    Q.  When did you find out about the trade and that you were heading out there?   JEFF GREEN:  I think when they announced it -- I think they announced it before Kevin was picked, I believe.  That\\'s the word but I didn\\'t realize that I was going to be that pick until maybe after the third pick.  I think Andy Katz said it in interviews.   I\\'ve been looking forward to it ever since the trade was mentioned, so it\\'s going to be a good ride.    Q.  Did you work out for Seattle at all?  I know you did some work with Boston; did you do anything with Seattle?   JEFF GREEN:  I didn\\'t, because nobody knew I was going to be in this position to make that trade.   But I\\'ve been in college three years.  They have seen me play.  So hopefully they note things that I\\'m capable of doing and hopefully I can make this thing work.    Q.  It\\'s a done deal obviously, but how would you have liked the situation in Boston?   JEFF GREEN:  It would have been nice with Doc Rivers being the coach and the coach has seen me a lot and it will be nice.  Things happen for a reason and hopefully this is the best situation for me.    Q.  Did you get a chance to speak with Sam Presti and how did that conversation go?   JEFF GREEN:  I have not.  I just came out of the sitting room.  I\\'ve been waiting for there about two and a half hours to just finalize the trade and this is my first interview.  I\\'m just getting situated with the interview part and hopefully I get a chance before the night is over to have a conversation with him.    Q.  How emotional was the moment for you your mother certainly looked like it --   JEFF GREEN:  My, mom, yeah.  My mom cried her heart out.  She\\'s been waiting for this for a long time.  She\\'s happy for me.   But I didn\\'t want to shed a tear.  I tried to hold it back and did the best I can but they almost came out.  It\\'s very emotional.  It\\'s something I\\'ve been wanting to happen since I was young and finally for it to be here is a blessing.  I\\'m very excited and ready to get it started.    Q.  What exactly have you been doing for the last three hours?   JEFF GREEN:  Sitting and watching other players come in who have been drafted.  You know, just telling them congratulations and good luck.  You know, just complimenting them on their seasons and being drafted.  So I\\'ve just been hanging out.

When you walked past the television, you saw the trade with Ray; what are your thoughts on that deal?   KEVIN DURANT:  Ray Allen is a great player, and it would have been fun learning from him, but Delonte West and Szczerbiak are not bad at all, great players and looking forward to playing with them.  Jeff is from D.C. so it's going to be an easy transition knowing those two guys.  So I can't wait.     Q.  You said yesterday that you didn't have to save the franchise because Ray was going to be there.   KEVIN DURANT:  Knew you was going to say that.  (Laughter).    Q.  Are you the savior now?   KEVIN DURANT:  Not at all.  Not at all.  When you play since you were eight or nine years old, you know the game is not a one-man sport.  I'm far from being a savior.  I'm just trying to contribute to the team as much as I can and I can't wait to be a SuperSonic.    Q.  How well do you know Jeff, being from the area, and also, with Ray gone, do you really stop lobbying Rashard now to stick around?   KEVIN DURANT:  I know Jeff pretty well, on a D.C. Blue Devils team and we gained a friendship from there.  He's a great player and I can't wait to play with him.   Now that Ray is gone, and I think Rashard is a free agent -- I'd love to get him back, he's a great player and one of my idols as well and now he's my teammate -- well, I hope he's my teammate.  If he's there, it's going to be a plus.    Q.  Greg joked before that you guys are constantly going to be linked in the future; every time his name is mentioned, yours is.  Do you feel that is something that's going to contribute throughout your NBA career with him?   KEVIN DURANT:  I know we are going to be linked for a long time.  We are 1 and 2.  We were 1 and 2 in high school.  We were both in the northwest.   I don't see me and him as player rivalries; our teams could be rivalries, but we play two different positions.  It's been great getting to know Greg as a friend and gaining a new friendship.    Q.  When David Stern walked up to announce the No. 1 pick, was there a moment with your fingers crossed and maybe your name might slip out of his mouth?   KEVIN DURANT:  I didn't know what was going on.  I didn't know who he was going to pick.  I held my mother's hand and we both looked at each other in the eye and when he said Greg, I figured where I was going to be going next.   I'm happy for Greg.  I went and gave his mom a hug and a kiss and congratulated their family.  It's going to be fun playing against him.    Q.  Does the link between you and Greg remind you of any other players in NBA history?  And also, when did you know that you were going to Seattle?   KEVIN DURANT:  I wouldn't say we remind of anybody else in the history of the NBA.  I think we are two different players and different from any other players that's been drafted 1 and 2.   Once I heard his name and No. 1, I had a little idea where I was going to go, maybe Seattle, maybe Atlanta.  But once they called my name, I shed a few tears and my mom shed some tears and my brother was happy for me and my godfather and I can't wait to see them out there after dealing with all of you guys.    Q.  You mentioned Jeff, Rashard Lewis and yourself, all small forwards; what do you think you'll be playing most with the Sonics?   KEVIN DURANT:  We're not small forwards.  All three of us can do a lot on the floor.  Jeff can play the 5, the 4, the 3; Rashard Lewis can do just about anything on the floor and I try to do just about anything on the floor.  We all complement each other very well.  It's going to be fun learning from the two guys and I can't wait.  \"}, 'Mike Conley, Jr.': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=43879', 'text': \"Q.

MI KE CONLEY, JR.:  Definitely.  I have a lot of family members in the Memphis and Arkansas area.  So I'll be close to home either way I go.    Q.  Your reaction to a year ago at this time thinking you were going to be in college for two or three years, and now you're the No. 4 pick in the Draft.   MIKE CONLEY, JR.:  It's been a whirlwind.  I had no idea, or a year ago I would have not thought I'd be in this position at all.  I had planned on staying in college as long as I could and trying to get a degree as fast as I could.  And the way that last year went and the things that happened, you know, I was just so grateful and blessed to be in this situation.   I'm happy right now that I've worked so hard to get here and I'm happy with where I'm going.    Q.  Greg said he planned whatever it took to somehow get a degree from Ohio State; do you plan the same thing?   MIKE CONLEY, JR.:  Definitely, definitely.  I know I'll get it over time.  I'll definitely try to chip away as much as I can and try to get back on campus and enjoy that and get that education, because I know I definitely want to do it.  But I know my mom would never let me live if I didn't.    Q.  So you played with Greg for a long time; how about playing with --   MIKE CONLEY, JR.:  It's going to be different, the big men are different and they have different mind-sets.  I'm sure I'll get to know him a lot better and once I do, I think it will be smooth sailing from there just like it was with Greg.  \"}, 'Wilson Chandler': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=43884', 'text': \"Q.

Your playing style has been compared to a very popular Knicks player, Allan Houston.  Do you feel any extra pressure because of that?   WILSON CHANDLER:  I don't feel any extra pressure, but it's a wonderful thing to be compared to a great player like that.   I'm going to come in and work at every aspect of my game and try to give the Knicks whatever they need out of me.  So I'm looking forward to the challenge.    Q.  Where do you see yourself immediately fitting in with this team as it currently is constituted again; where do you see yourself fitting in with this team?   WILSON CHANDLER:  Right now I can't tell you, but whatever the coaches need, the team needs, I'm going to try to do that and just fill that spot.    Q.  What do you think about the pressure of playing in New York?  Is that something you're looking forward to?   WILSON CHANDLER:  That's something I'm looking forward to, because there's always pressure, but New York is the biggest stage right now.

Just looking forward to playing for the Supersonics.    Q. Did you have a feeling that Seattle was in the picture for you, and the reason this becomes interesting is that you know that franchise may be moving to Oklahoma City, so guess you won't be buying any property in King County?  RUSSELL WESTBROOK: Not any time soon but real fortunate that Seattle picked me and now I've got to go and do my job.    Q. Earlier in the year, more so in the season, you were not really being mentioned with the top five guys; how does it feel to sneak away to Seattle?   RUSSELL WESTBROOK: It feels great. I worked so hard to get to the best possible positions I could possibly be in and this is one of the best possible positions there is, and now I have to keep working to be at the top.    Q. Fortunately Seattle is in the same Western Conference so there's a chance for your family and friends to see new Los Angeles a few times; is that also a factor in saying, please don't move to Oklahoma City?   RUSSELL WESTBROOK: A little bit but at the same time my family is always by my side, so whatever it takes to come to the games, they will be there, so I'm not worried about that.    Q. You mentioned the other day that you kind of like the fact that you did not have a lot of attention on you coming out of high school and were able to sneak up on people going into the draft. Now that you've got a top five pick to your credit, how do you see yourself going forward?  RUSSELL WESTBROOK: I've got to do the same thing I've been doing.

Q. Can you just talk a little more about what it means to be a lottery pick, does that make it sweeter?   BRANDON RUSH: It doesn't make any difference, as long as I was in the first round I was happy about it and then going to an organization like Portland and they have some good, young talent, I'm happy to be out there.

My agent just told me that, I guess a minute before David Stern came on the podium, so, relief.    Q. Had you talked to Kevin Pritchard before?  BRANDON RUSH: Not really. I talked to him when I went to work out a little bit but it wasn't anything really deep.   Q. Going too training camp, safe to say you won't get any attention because of another guy drafted last year?  BRANDON RUSH: Yeah, it will be a relief and looking forward to training camp.   Q.

Did you make the connection that Julian (Wright) got picked 13th last year?   BRANDON RUSH: Oh, that's great. I thought he was picked 14th for some reason.

John Paxson was just on saying that he doesn't think that you need to come in and contribute right away. I was wondering, do you expect to come in and contribute right away?

Being a point guard and coming in and starting, I have to show a little bit of leadership and let everyone know that I really want to be there.    Q. With that said, can you just talk about how you're going to fit in with the other guards that Chicago has already?  DERRICK ROSE: There's going to be moves and they don't know who is going to be there but the guards they have now are great guards. I've seen them here and there and Ben Gordon but it's a great fit.    Q. Was there any doubt in your mind that you would be the No. 1 pick? Did it ever go back and forth that you may not have been that guy?   DERRICK ROSE: Yeah, I was a little nervous when they came back out, but I always had that in my mind that I want to be No. 1.   So it was great hearing my name and being the No. 1 pick.    Q. The usual distractions, friends, you've only been a year away from high school and friends, how does one deal with that and concentrate on business?   DERRICK ROSE: My situation is different. I have a small circle. I have like five people that I really hang with. So it's going to be real tough to try to get a hold of me.   Q. How does it feel going to a team that is not that far away? Usually the No. 1 pick goes to a team that's many years away; Chicago could be a contender again. How does it feel going to a quality club right now?  DERRICK ROSE: It feels great to go in and compete. I'm just blessed to be in that position right now, because a lot of people aren't, and just knowing that we are a few pieces away from really contending as a team, it just makes me happy.    Q.

I can play multiple positions, so I think that I will be a great fit.    Q. Which position do you feel most comfortable going into your NBA career?

I had a great work out for the Memphis Grizzlies, and feel like I can come in and contribute right away and come in right away and play the power forward position.

What about the off-the-court stuff that season tickets and fans are down; what will you do off the court to get the enthusiasm back?

Phoenix is about a six-hour drive?  ROBIN LOPEZ: Actually my base was Santa Monica during the workout process, but I'm from Fresno, California. Fresno is four hours north of Santa Monica -- I'll have to go to Fresno, Barstow, Phoenix.    Q. Now that you have both been drafted, who wins if you have opening game?  ROBIN LOPEZ: I'm going to go with the same answer, me, me and the Suns.  \"}, 'DeAndre Jordan': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=50473', 'text': \"Q. Talk about getting drafted by the Clippers?  DeANDRE JORDAN: The Clippers is just a great organization. They have some great guys and they picked me, hoping that I fit in well, and I know they drafted Eric Gordon, so hopefully it will be a good fit for me.    Q. It says you're a Phoenix Suns fan; have you changed your allegiance?  DeANDRE JORDAN: I was always a fan because of the pick-and-roll game with Steve Nash, so that was an offense that I wanted to be in. With the Clippers we'll work some things like that, and hopefully I'll fit in well.    Q. Obviously there was a lot of speculation about where you would go in the draft; were you surprised that you were still here in the second round?  DeANDRE JORDAN: Yeah, I was.   But everything happens for a reason, and I'm just going to take this and try to make something work.  \"}, 'Serge Ibaka': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=50477', 'text': \"Q. If you could start with your feelings about being drafted and describe your style of play.   SERGE IBAKA: This is a big day for me, a very important day in my life. I feel that this is the beginning and this is a great beginning and I'm very happy.    Q. Wondering who your favorite NBA basketball players are, and how much did you follow the game growing up?  SERGE IBAKA: Growing up, my favorite player was Kevin Garnett and still is, for how he plays, and his talent and energy.    Q. Just another question, how much do you know about the City of Seattle and the team that Seattle has, a very young team, possibly one of our best young stars, Kevin Durant; do you know much about the city?   SERGE IBAKA: It's been only a few days since I've been here in the United States working out for teams and visiting some cities, but I don't really know about Seattle for the team.  \"}, 'Eric Gordon': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=50486', 'text': \"Q. Eric, you and O.J. and Russ were all in the top seven, and all kind of have had combo guard game. How do you see that fitting into the league as the play has developed over the last few years?   ERIC GORDON: I would say that's a great situation for us. Some teams need point guards and some teams need shooting guards and just play whatever position the coach has us assigned to.    Q. You certainly have the L.A. look tonight; from a business point of view, how important is it to be in a big market, someone like yourself, successful athlete, with the endorsement opportunities that are available to you, is that on your mind?  ERIC GORDON: Not really. I'm just glad to be drafted here today to the L.A. Clippers. Better weather than Indiana, and just overall I thought it would be a great situation.    Q. Bad traffic, though.   ERIC GORDON: Yeah, you've got to get used to it, though.    Q. A lot of people like to compare where your game to Ben Gordon but he's yet to be a starter in the league, so how do you feel about that?  ERIC GORDON: Well, it just depends on your situation. There's a lot of guys who played that position that are All-Stars.   I mean, just because I pattern my game after his doesn't mean that I might not be an All-Star in the future.   Q. What do you see as the best strengths of the fact that you can be a swing man and sort of play either one of those two positions; and specifically, in your offensive game?  ERIC GORDON: I think being able to play point guard and shooting guard, I think I'm strong enough on power guys that are either 1s or 2s in the league, and obviously the scoring part of it, I think I can take over.  \"}, 'Danilo Gallinari': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=50487', 'text': \"Q.

As I'm sure you already know for the most part, the European players are pretty much hit or miss; can you explain what makes you different than any other European player?  DANILO GALLINARI: I just don't know. I like to say to journalists and coaches that say this -- I don't know, I let you say that.   Q. Were you expecting to go to the Knicks?   DANILO GALLINARI: I didn't really know where I was going, so to be here, I am so happy, but I didn't know.    Q. I know this is a dream come true for you, but was it hard to hear the boos when your name was announced and the city you were going to play in?   DANILO GALLINARI: It's a part of the game, all of the players has got to hear this. Not every time you can hear good things. So it's normal here.    Q. Being a foreign-born player, was it important to be in a big city like New York where some players who have wound up in smaller cities say it's a harder adjustment; was that on your mind?  DANILO GALLINARI: Yes, I think it's a good situation for that, and I think New York is similar to Milan and I would like to be hear, and it's nice.    Q. How familiar are you with Coach D'Antoni?   DANILO GALLINARI: If I met him? Oh, I met him only one time. My father knows him. I don't know him like my father. So I met him only one time six years ago.    Q. Do you feel it was unfair to get booed since they don't really know you or your game?   DANILO GALLINARI: No, I feel normal and comfortable with that. I have got no problem and it's my work to prove to everybody that I am a good player.   So that's everything on me.    Q. For people who have not seen you play, what NBA player would you say you are most similar to?   DANILO GALLINARI: I really don't know. I will try to bring my European game, also, here and Mark D'Antoni played many, many years in Europe. I played in Europe and now to be here, I really don't know how to compare me to another player; I don't know.    Q. How much do you know about the Knicks franchise and the hard times they have fallen on the past few seasons?   DANILO GALLINARI: I know, I have seen some cassettes in Italy, and I remember the time when Ewing was playing here and New York was doing so well. In the last two or three years, they didn't do so well, but I hope in the future that welcome back.    Q. Did you talk to Andrea and Mark about this process?  DANILO GALLINARI: We didn't talk so much about the process because when we came for the European Championship, everybody was talking about the NBA to them and I didn't want to rock the boat and talk about the NBA, so we talked about other things.    Q. Did you see the Knicks play at all last year?  DANILO GALLINARI: I don't think they played so, so, well.    Q. Any impressions?   DANILO GALLINARI: No, I don't have any impressions.    Q. Also do you feel better about the fact that Coach speaks fluent Italian? Is that one more level of comfort for you?   DANILO GALLINARI: For sure, we can talk some Italian and it can come back. In the last few days Italian journalists tell me that his Italian in the last five or six years has not done so well.    Q. Is there something that you can say to the fans that would make them feel better or an assurance you could give them about yourself?   DANILO GALLINARI: I would say forza Italia, and forza New York.

JOEY DORSEY: It was from 21 to 29, Detroit, but yeah, I'm just happy being picked. Still excited.   Q. Are you surprised that Chris has not gone yet?   JOEY DORSEY: Very, very surprised. Me and Chris talked, and he was like -- he wasn't going to watch it. Right now he's in the air flying right now. He said he wasn't even going to watch the draft.    Q.

You were one of the leaders of a very experienced college team, a very tight-knit group of guys, and what are you going to bring to your new NBA team which is kind of a young team, trying to still feel its way out; not just what you do on the court, but your leadership role?  MARIO CHALMERS: Just try to provide leadership and try and come in there and learn my role and see what the coaches like and just go out there and give it my all every day.    Q. Can you just talk about watching Brandon and Darrell waiting for so long, what was it like watching them getting drafted in the first round?

What was your reaction --  MICHAEL BEASLEY: I was a little surprised, we had talked before the draft, and just to hear my name called, it took a lot of pressure off.    Q. So you thought you might not be picked by them?  MICHAEL BEASLEY: Yeah, that was going through my head.    Q. What was today like for you? Were you nervous? What was it like?  MICHAEL BEASLEY: I was tired. Couldn't get no sleep last night. Woke up and it was on my mind all day.   Now it be here and it's over, I can sleep again.    Q. Any buzz on shoe deals?   MICHAEL BEASLEY: Not yet. (Smiling).   Q. Next time around going to Miami, will you bring flip flops?   MICHAEL BEASLEY: I'll bring a rain coat. Last time I was there in flip flops, there was a lot of rain, but I'll bring my whole wardrobe this time.   Q. How do you think you will fit in with the Heat, and how will you celebrate tonight?  MICHAEL BEASLEY: Celebrate with the guys, O.J., Derek, Russell, Kevin Love, go have fun tonight.   But I think I can fit in well, I think I can take a lot of pressure off.   Q. You must have had some scenario because like you said, you looked surprised, or not sure what the word was, but what did you think was going to happen there?  MICHAEL BEASLEY: Honestly I don't know. I mean, I hear a lot of talk, 4, 3, 4 -- so I was kind of expecting the worst. When they called my name, just kind of woke me up a bit.   Q. This is the first time freshmen have gone 1, 2, 3. Did you have any indication that the summer camps, that you guys would have this much of an impact?  MICHAEL BEASLEY: We actually talked about this earlier. We all grew up together and we all grew up playing against each other and we all made a pact together that we would be here.   Just to see it all fall into place and see it all happen is kind of crazy.    Q. As a freshman, you obviously have a lot of experience in the real world. Are you going to be meeting with your agent and accountant and lawyers as quickly as possible for investment advice; are you prepared for all of that?   MICHAEL BEASLEY: Came in kind of in a hurry. That's a lot -- I guess I will. But not right now.    Q. You worked so hard to get to this moment; what does it feel like to get to this point, and also do you think you'll be in Dwyane's top five now?   MICHAEL BEASLEY: Hopefully. I couldn't call him earlier because of the minutes, but I just feel great and I feel relieved. My hard work finally paid off and I won't stop working. I'm going to continue to work and try to ride this thing out.    Q. I saw Kevin Durant come up to you before the draft, for you to go back-to-back; talk about how rare that is for two guys from the same place to go No. 2 in back-to-back years?   MICHAEL BEASLEY: That's crazy. I don't think it could have played out any better than it did. Me and Kevin grew up, like I said and we've been best friends since a young age. And for both of us to have identical careers so far is really amazing.    Q. Your advice yesterday was to keep smiling; are people going to be smiling down in Miami?  MICHAEL BEASLEY: I hope we're going to bring a lot of smiles to Miami. We're going to bring a better record to Miami and hopefully a championship.    Q. Granted he has only one year left on his contract but Shawn Marion is on the Heat, so what role do you see yourself playing?  MICHAEL BEASLEY: Small four, big three, pretty much whatever the team needs. Going to sit down and talk to Coach, whatever he tells me, that's what I'll be doing.  \"}, 'Jerryd Bayless': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=50482', 'text': \"Q.

JERRYD BAYLESS: I think that you have to go out there and play hard. Coach obviously drafted me for a reason, and hopefully sees something that he likes, and he'll figure that out.    Q. A lot of people were talking about you maybe going second or third in the draft. What is it like sitting there waiting, and do you feel like you have something to prove now?

You got picked by a Larry Bird, he saw something in your game that he wanted to bring to his team; how does that make you feel?  JERRYD BAYLESS: Definitely flattering. Everybody wants to be named with those great players such as Larry Bird, and being selected by him is definitely something I should be excited about, so looking forward to meeting him tomorrow.   Q. You've been complimentary to other guards; do you feel that you were victim of supply and demand, that it was just not the best year to be a great guard in the Pac-10?  JERRYD BAYLESS: You know, I don't really know what it was, so I'm just going to look past it to the great opportunity at hand and start working hard for the Indiana Pacers.   Q. How would you stand to maybe somebody who was worried about you not being able to fill either of the two guard positions?   JERRYD BAYLESS: I think they are crazy, that's what I think.

I didn't work out for New Orleans, so it's a blessing just to be picked up.   Q.

JOE ALEXANDER: Yeah, my family is the most important thing to me in my life, and being able to spend these last couple of days with them has been really valuable to me, and this is such an important time for me; and to be able to share it with people that I care about is important.    Q. Is there any way -- you mentioned all of the work and all of the stories of how you used to sleep in the gym and all of the work that you put in even before you got to WV -- to put all of that in context with how it worked out for you today?

I think it\\'s a good challenge for me.    Q. Did Coach Brown talk to you a lot before you went down there for the workout?  ALEXIS AJINCA: Yeah, for the workout, he teach me like a song, like if I\\'m playing just before the draft.   Q. Where do you see yourself fitting in with the other big men that already play in Charlotte? How do you see yourself fitting in with the team?   ALEXIS AJINCA: I think on this ballclub there is a lot of big guys because I play against some of them, and everybody wanted to play for Bobcats because they got a 9 before the 20. Everybody wanted to show their skills, and if you can jump and run, like everybody.    Q. How familiar are you with other players from France? Do you know Tony Parker well? Have the guys that made the jump from France to the League given you any help? Have they spoken to you at all about making the jump to the NBA?  ALEXIS AJINCA: Yeah, I saw Didier Mbenga in L.A.; he\\'s not a French player but he is from Congo and speaks French and he gave me some lessons for playing, and the French players, they are just behind me.  '}}, 2009: {'Terrence Williams': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=57436', 'text': \"Q. You're playing in the New York, New Jersey area, your all-around game will definitely contribute to the Nets, with Vince Carter being traded, that will give you an opportunity to showcase your skills.   TERRENCE WILLIAMS: Yeah, I think I woke up this morning and kind of had sort of an idea what was going to happen when I seen that Vince Carter trade go down.   So I'm just honored to be here. It's a great market with New Jersey, you know, they will be moving to Brooklyn eventually. Everything is just on the up and up. I'm just happy to be a part of this whole organization right now.    Q. Nobody is really expecting the Nets to do much the next couple of years, and they may not get until Brooklyn hopefully three or four years at best, does that take some of the pressure off you knowing that you don't have to deliver a lot in the first year or two, nobody is expecting much of the franchise, does that take the pressure off?  TERRENCE WILLIAMS: I love to win, so losing is a lot of pressure on me. I come from a winning program, so I'm going to come in and try to turn the program around. It is a lot of pressure, because you are in the NBA and you are part of an organization and you want to win and you want to win for the fans also.   It is a lot of pressure no matter what the circumstances are or the expectations.   Q. Talk about some of your new teammates, Devin Harris and Courtney Lee or Lopez, some of these guys you'll play with, how do you feel about that?  TERRENCE WILLIAMS: Great players. Everybody knows Devin Harris, he's an All-Star and he's a great player. You see what Courtney Lee does off the bench, so that's a great asset to the team. Lopez, I played against him when he was at Stanford in the tournament, great player.   So we have a lot of key, young, great players. All we've got to do, it may take a year or two, who knows, it may take one year but bring our great young players together and try to build from what we already established last year.   Q. What does it say that a player like you goes this high in the NBA Draft?   TERRENCE WILLIAMS: Like the Adidas logo, anything is possible. You never know, a lot of people had me late first round, and after a couple workouts, he could go higher. It just goes to show you after four years, hard work does pay off, from being a little kid playing with a ball to talking with you guys here today.    Q. You're the first senior taken in the Draft. What does that say about how the game has changed over the years?   TERRENCE WILLIAMS: It says a lot. You know, it says -- like I said, you stay in school four years, it does pay off for you. To go 11 -- some people call it a weak Draft. I think it's a great Draft. It's just not a lot of clear-cut picks in the Draft like there was in years before. Like I said, it shows if you stay in school four years, it pays off for you and it shows indicative of tonight, going first of the seniors.   Q. Are you interested in the fashion? And are you happy to be in this market for the culture? This is a good place to be.   TERRENCE WILLIAMS: This is a great market, trust me, for a lot of reasons. If you love to shop -- I love to shop -- New York is right across the bridge, New Jersey is right there.   So everything works out perfect for me. I have no complaints for me about being here in the Tri-Cities. I look forward to this and going across the water for my press conference and thank you for the suit comment, I'll tell my girlfriend that.    Q. She picked all that?  TERRENCE WILLIAMS: She did all this. She has great taste.  \"}, 'Hasheem Thabeet': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=57429', 'text': \"Q. Offensively, we all know that your defensive skills are definitely NBA-ready but offensively what are you going to be working on?   HASHEEM THABEET: I'm trying to get as many post games as I can. The whole season I spent out working on my offense and working with so many different people and to me this is a great opportunity to come out here and go play. I'm looking forward and I talk to the guys in Memphis every day, you know, Rudy and all of the guys are pretty good friends of mine, and finally I was chosen to go out there. So I'm happy and excited.    Q. A big man is only as good as his point guard; have you had a chance to talk to Mike Conley and what do you think of playing with Mike?  HASHEEM THABEET: I haven't had a chance to talk to him. He's a cool player. It's a young team and I'm looking forward to going out there and going with them. It should be interesting. I usually watch a lot of NBA games and I got to catch his game and it's pretty good.   I look forward to being a part of the Grizzlies organization.    Q. You had to leave home; what does it mean to share this with your family?  HASHEEM THABEET: It's a blessing. The first five years I didn't get to see my family and then got to see -- I used to speak to them on the phone every two or three weeks, and now they are here and get to experience this with me. I don't even know how to explain that. It's just a great feeling and I'm happy that she was there to experience it.    Q. Did Memphis give you an indication they were going to take you or were you surprised?  HASHEEM THABEET: I was surprised. They used to -- they was calling my agent, all of these teams, they was all calling my agent. I was waiting to hear, you know, what's going to happen. I ended up in Memphis, so I'm happy.   I was going to be happy wherever I ended up. This for me, again, is a great opportunity for me to go out there and play ball and have fun.    Q. Did you have in your mind when you came to the United States that maybe you would be the No. 2 pick in the Draft? How I improbable is this?   HASHEEM THABEET: Wow, when I came in, I never thought, first of all, I would be able to make it to Division I basketball. Ended up at UCONN, and when I got to UCONN, I got to be coached by Jim Calhoun. He pushed me since day one.  I had to believe in myself that I can definitely do it. After my freshman year, I was young and I had to grow up and he prepared me mentally pretty well for me to be, you know, believe in myself. He challenged me and I can challenge myself to be man enough to go out there and play ball, and I ended up believing in myself since my freshman year, if you remember, everybody was asking if I'm believing on that. My sophomore year, it was more financially a decision and I had to talk to a lot of people. I remember Coach Calhoun told me after my freshman year, if you leave after this year, it's going to be the worst mistake in your life. I had to believe in him and trust him and told my family they can wait for a couple of years for me to be in the NBA and go out there and play ball and put myself out there. To me, this is a blessing.   Q. Memphis is known for great music, great food, pro basketball, not so much. How much do you know about the City of Memphis and are you concerned about a franchise that has been a colossal failure?   HASHEEM THABEET: Again, to me, I was going to be good wherever I ended up. I was born and raised in Tanzania and lived in Mississippi, went to UCONN and now Memphis. So it's another lesson that I have to learn. I've been dealing with different kinds of culture.  I'll just go out there and have fun and be happy. Wherever I be, I know I'll be good. I was able to adapt and overcome a lot of stuff since I got to the U.S. at the age of 14, so I believe this is not going to be as hard as a lot of people think.  \"}, 'Ricky Rubio': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=57430', 'text': \"Q. What was your reaction hearing that the Bulls took Johnny Flynn.   RICKY RUBIO: That's a big surprise for me they took another point guard. But we are going to see what they want. I don't know yet what exactly they want.    Q. I don't mean to be funny here, it gets very cold in Minnesota. Is that something that would weigh your decision of staying in Europe or coming to the NBA?  RICKY RUBIO: I don't know yet, I have to think about that, because I'm just three minutes from a Timberwolves player. So I'm going to talk with my agent about that and we are going to see.   Q. Do you ever think about cold weather; is that an issue?  RICKY RUBIO: It's cold there. Yeah, my mom hates cold places. But we are going to see.    Q. I wanted to ask you, your Olympic experience, how much did that really help you being able to gauge playing against the top talent?   RICKY RUBIO: It's helped me a lot because I played against the best players in the NBA, so that means that I can play here.   I realized in the Olympic Games that I'm feeling good in the game, so that moment, I realize that I can play here, and that helps me a lot.    Q. Point guards are usually the traditional leader on the court. Being from a different country and being so young, how do you think that role will play out for you?  RICKY RUBIO: Oh, that's very hard, but when I was like 14 years old, I went to the professional team and there are guys 30 years old who don't listen to me in the beginning but after they see I can be a very good point guard and put them in the right way, and they believe in me. So I want to try to do the same here.    Q. How would you describe your game to people who have not seen you play?   RICKY RUBIO: Thinking about my teammates, if they are happy or not, who loves to pass and run and who loves to do defense, too.    Q. I wanted to just ask you about -- you mentioned the buy out situation. You mentioned the other day that it's your dream to come to the NBA, but is there any question about whether you're going to try to buy yourself out of the contract?  RICKY RUBIO: Well, now I know where I'm going to go, so I have to talk with the team, what exactly they want about me, and if necessary, I'm going to pay the buy out. We are closer to an agreement with the team, so we are going to see.   Q. Are you excited to go to Minnesota?  RICKY RUBIO: I'm excited to come to the NBA.    Q. Having said that you're excited to come to the NBA, were you hoping to be in more of an international type of market? It's not a very international city.   RICKY RUBIO: Yes, but I'm not thinking about the marketing right now. I'm thinking about to play minutes. That's my love. I want to play basketball, and if they give me minutes, I'm going to come.  \"}, 'Jonas Jerebko': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=57445', 'text': \"Q. Could you just go into your style of play and what you'll bring to the Pistons?   JONAS JEREBKO: A lot of energy, first of all, defense. I'm just going to try to do what's best for the team.   I'm looking forward to it. Detroit has got a great team, and I'm going to have to contribute to the team.    Q. And what do you know about your teammates, who are you looking forward to playing with?   JONAS JEREBKO: I was there and I had a really good principle. They have Tayshaun Prince in my position and can learn a lot from a guy like that. I know they have a great team and I'm looking forward to going there.    Q. How do you feel after waiting a long time?  JONAS JEREBKO: No, it's been a long time, but when I heard my name, I got very happy.   So that's what matters.    Q. How close are you to Tony Ronzone?  JONAS JEREBKO: He's watched a lot of my games. I've seen him at camp. I like the Detroit organization and Joe Dumars. It's going to be a good experience.  \"}, 'Brandon Jennings': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=57438', 'text': \"Q. Brandon, talk about I know that you love to pass the ball and Milwaukee has some talent inside with Andrew and Villanueva, talk about how you look forward to playing with them.   BRANDON JENNINGS: I'm really excited about this. I went down there for a work-out and got there a little early and stayed for three days and got to see the city. It's not bad what everybody thinks. They re-signed Charlie, got Michael Redd get healthy, you might be able to see the Bucks in the playoffs again.    Q. Are you going to write a memoire on your experiences in Europe?  BRANDON JENNINGS: I don't know right now. We'll see.    Q. Yesterday you talked about the journey. Given what you've been through, can you talk about how you're feeling?  BRANDON JENNINGS: Just being overseas, you know, made me more humble. I was probably just a little upset to see the guys go before me. You know, it just made me more hungrier now. I can't wait until the Summer League starts and the regular season.   Q. Is your agent Mr. Duffy?  BRANDON JENNINGS: Yes, he is.    Q. I had seen a memo saying that you were not going to be here tonight; I guess the last man in the green room I guess is what he feared. But you're here; what was that all about?  BRANDON JENNINGS: I flew in, with my family members, there were 20 of us, and I just felt like spending the time with them in this whole process because they have been there for me since day one. It was better to spend it with my family.   Q. He was concerned that your stock was dropping; obviously it wasn't the case.   BRANDON JENNINGS: No, it wasn't, but you never want to chance it.    Q. Do you think you would have went higher had you played in college? Do you think you would have went maybe in the top five if you had gone to Arizona and put up huge numbers?  BRANDON JENNINGS: Yeah, probably, but like I said, the experience that I have gotten over there, you know, you can't complain with that. I'm not really a rookie, but I am a rookie in the NBA. This is really my second year as being a pro.   I think I'm ready. I'm more ready than a lot of these other players. A lot of these other players have a lot to learn with the pro game, but I think I've got to down a little bit.   Q. What did you learn specifically about your game in the past year playing in Europe?   BRANDON JENNINGS: Well, I changed a lot. My game was more mature now. I know how to run the pick-and-roll situation. I'm a lot tougher than I was before. In high school, you just run through everybody. But over there, you know, it's like life or death. So it's made me a stronger person.    Q. And do you think you're the best point guard in this Draft?   BRANDON JENNINGS: Yes, I do. Of course I do. You know, I have a lot of confidence in my game, and you know, we'll see. We'll see. That's all I've got to say. We'll see.    Q. Yesterday you talked about just the social and cultural growth that you had by going overseas, and you mentioned Jeremy Tyler. Obviously it's not for everyone, but would you say that a young man can mature and grow more so than going to college?  BRANDON JENNINGS: Yes, a lot. You're with grown men every day, probably it you go over there, you're probably living by yourself so you have to mature faster.  I think what Jeremy Tyler is doing is awesome, if he stays over there for two years, I guarantee he'll be the No. 1 pick in the NBA Draft, for sure, because he'll come out and be more mature and more developed and more ready than anybody else.    Q. Given that you were slipping, how surprised were you when you heard your name called as the tenth pick?  BRANDON JENNINGS: Well, I was real surprised. When I worked out for the Bucks, it was one of my best workouts so far. A lot of top guards in that workout.   The coach there, he's a point guard, and, you know, I'm happy I got picked to the Bucks.    Q. Do you feel like you can create some kind of a bond with Bogut because he played overseas?  BRANDON JENNINGS: I don't really know. I can't really answer that. All I can say is, we'll see.  \"}, 'Jrue Holiday': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=57440', 'text': \"Q. Jrue, wanted to ask you, you're teaming up with Darren on the back board; talk about how you look forward to hearing his name being picked, as well.   JRUE HOLIDAY: I'm happy for him. Definitely teaming up with him, it could have been one of the greatest things. He's such a great point guard. He's one of the All-Stars in college basketball, so I mean, I learned a lot from him offensively, defensively, because he's a defensive style player and just an offensive genius.    Q. Having been preached defense, how is that going to help you in the NBA being such a good defender?   JRUE HOLIDAY: Just my size, that helps me, too, because I can go out there with the little guys and with my size being 6-4, I can guard point guards or I can go up to the two guards, or maybe even three.    Q. There was a great cover on Slam Magazine; talk about how amazing that cover was at that time.   JRUE HOLIDAY: That's great. It's basketball and we know each other very well. I'm happy for Lance Stephenson if he comes up. If he does well, he's definitely going to be lottery.    Q. Bittersweet, you staying in the Green Room until 17 but you're going to the Philadelphia 76ers, a playoff team, how are you going to translate into the NBA for a team lake?  JRUE HOLIDAY: I'm excited. They have Andre Miller who is a great point guard. I can definitely learn from him. You know, a playoff team, I get to experience that. I get to experience my first year, the pleasure of being in the playoffs, and playing against the best team.    Q. A lot of athletes complain that fans almost cross the line sometimes on being hard on them there; how familiar are you with the city of Philadelphia?  JRUE HOLIDAY: I've been there a couple of times. I'm not that familiar with it. But the way you're describing it, it sounds like L.A.   Q. L.A., the fans are laid back, they leave the game in the 6th inning in Dodger Stadium.  JRUE HOLIDAY: That's Dodgers. If you go to a Laker game, they are pretty tough.    Q. Did you see the 76ers play last year and what were your impressions of them?  JRUE HOLIDAY: You know, Iguodala and Andre Miller, they are the two that stood out to me, and they are great players and I'm trying to take something from both of them.  \"}, 'Jordan Hill': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=57434', 'text': \"Q. Reaction, going to the Knicks.   JORDAN HILL: Definitely happy. Knicks is definitely a good fit for me because it's an up-tempo team and I can run the floor, so definitely it's a good fit for me.    Q. What was your reaction to the crowd response?   JORDAN HILL: I mean, that type of crowd, if they don't get who they want, they will give a couple of boos. But there was some that wanted me to go there, wanted me to come to the Knicks. I feel appreciated. But it's just how you feel. I'm just going out and trying to play basketball. I'm just happy I'm on the team.    Q. Coming into the Draft, there was a lot of talk that the Knicks were definitely targeting and you some others, did they gave you a strong indication that you were the guy they wanted?  JORDAN HILL: No, I really didn't hear nothing. Well, I heard the same thing but they didn't make no lockdown situation.   After the No. 2 pick, I felt it was just up in the air. Just hoping, you know, wait until my name was called and I was chosen.   Q. Your rise coming into the season has been pretty dramatic. How has it been for you just again this dramatic rise?   JORDAN HILL: It's been -- I went through a lot, it's tough, but I managed to have the right people behind me and the right supporting cast behind me. So I just tried to stay focused and keep my head on straight and go out there and go with what I want, go for what I want.    Q. Since you went to the University of Arizona, of course, Phoenix is nearby, Tucson, and you were close to the Phoenix Suns, what do you love about that system?  JORDAN HILL: Up tempo. When Lamar was up there, he was running the floor like no other, getting dunks after dunks after dunks. With a guard like Chris Duhon which is a pass-first guard, that's a good look for me, so just got to see how it is.    Q. Once Curry went to the Warriors, did you figure this might be it?  JORDAN HILL: Yeah, I would say either Curry or me. Once he got selected, I thought it could be me so I had to wait. I'm glad I waited just to make sure.    Q. You mentioned the fan reaction, you got a lot of fans calling you -- what are some of the more memorable stuff they said to you?  JORDAN HILL: I mean, like I said, it was fans that, you know, wanted somebody else. I did have fans that was like glad that I'm a Knick, glad that I'm with them. So I appreciate that. So I'm definitely a hard worker and I'm going to try my hardest to help the Knicks win games.    Q. Were you concerned about your basketball future when Coach Olson resigned suddenly before the start of the season? Did it worry you?   JORDAN HILL: Definitely not. I mean, it was not my decision for what Coach did. I'm glad I witnessed it in my college year because you can definitely do the same at the next level.   So I was there just to play basketball. I didn't really -- it didn't really matter to me what coaches I play under.    Q. Have you had a chance to talk to Coach D'Antoni about, has he mentioned comparing him to you, the conversation you all had?  JORDAN HILL: Yeah, he definitely compared me to Lamar, athleticism is the same. Lamar just worked hard and look where he's at now.   They see the same thing in me, so I know that D'Antoni is going to definitely get that out of me and develop me into the player I need to be.    Q. You may have really hit pay dirt here, even though you were not the first pick, you got the big media endorsement deals being in this town. Are you prepared to deal with all of us here? This is a small taste of what you'll get on a daily basis, sports talk radio and all that, are you prepared for the onslaught?  JORDAN HILL: Definitely, I have no problem talking, so just make sure I say the right thing is basically what I need to do.  I'm definitely ready for it.    Q. Obviously you're here now with the up-tempo system, but do you find this system the best fit for you?   JORDAN HILL: Well, it's definitely one of the best. Like I said, it was an up-tempo game and I run the floor like no other and I just love to run the floor and just try to get wide open for an easy dunk or whatever. So I definitely -- it is definitely a good fit for me.  \"}, 'Gerald Henderson': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=57437', 'text': \"Q. Talk about coming from the lineage of having a father who played in the league and playing for Larry Brown who preaches playing the game the right way.   GERALD HENDERSON: Coach Brown is great. I've known him since I was in middle school being from Philadelphia. I'm looking forward to playing for him and learning a lot of things. The workouts I've had with him, he teaches a lot, and I'm looking forward to just learning things from him and definitely being around Michael every day, that will be a great thing for me, being around, really, the best player that's played this game. I'm really looking forward to that.    Q. You get to stay in-state now but there are a lot of people in the State of North Carolina that don't like Duke basketball. Is that intimidating?   GERALD HENDERSON: No, I probably won't be thinking about that at all. I probably will just worry about the people that are supporting me and you know, it will be a great situation for me.    Q. Staying in-state, does it make it easier for you to finish up your degree at Duke?  GERALD HENDERSON: I'm sure it will. I plan to go back and finish up my degree. I don't have that many more classes to finish up. You know, just being close and in that vicinity it will definitely help me.   Q. Can you talk about what your dad said?  GERALD HENDERSON: You know, he just told me I made it. I worked so hard to get to this point, and he just congratulated me and told me I made it, and you know, it's good to hear those words.    Q. How has your dad's experience helped you specifically in the last little while, or did he just kind of leave you alone?  GERALD HENDERSON: You know, back when he was coming into the NBA, it really wasn't a process like we have to go through nowadays. You know, he probably only had one tryout, and you know, he did a pretty good job and he was a Celtic. It's a little different he's letting me go. He's given me some advice here and there but he's let me go through it and really grow by myself.    Q. Can you talk about the strides you've made in your game in the last year that helped to get you this high in the Draft?   GERALD HENDERSON: You know, I've worked on my skills and my shooting, my ball handling, my defense. I've worked on all that, but a big thing for me was just really having a bigger ego while I was on the court.   Coach K last summer preached to me, that will be the biggest thing for me to really believe I'm a good player. That's the first step to being a good player is believing that you are and that you can be. I took that attitude into the season.    Q. Having been a part of North Carolina basketball, even at the collegiate level, have you had a chance to really watch the Bobcats and see how your game might fit in there? What do you think of that team coming?   GERALD HENDERSON: I have watched them. Me and Jon Scheyer have a League Pass at home, so I was able to watch that a lot.   They had a good team. They are young, and you know, Coach Brown, he really teaches the game, and they play the game right. You know, this upcoming season should be fun. I think, you know, we'll be great.    Q. I watched an HBO documentary, the Battle for Tobacco Road; curious how you are looking forward to burying the hatchet with the Tar Heels.   GERALD HENDERSON: There are a lot of Carolina guys there but that stuff ends when you get off the court. There goes Tyler right there. Congrats, man.   We all play ball and go through the same stuff. It's like a camaraderie and we don't play on the same team but we respect what each of us does, and it's still a great thing.    Q. Did you see that HBO documentary?  GERALD HENDERSON: I did.    Q. What did you think?   GERALD HENDERSON: I thought it was pretty cool until they had that little piece at the end where it showed me hitting Tyler. I thought it was pretty good until that point. (Laughter).   Q. Speaking of that connection with Tyler, how surreal is it that you two are drafted back-to-back and he just walked by?  GERALD HENDERSON: It's pretty funny, actually. You know, me and him actually earlier got off the elevator to get on the bus at the same time. We've been in a few workouts together. We've actually played on the same teams as we've been going through the workouts. It's been pretty cool. Tyler is a great kid and I wish him the best.  \"}, 'James Harden': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=57428', 'text': \"Q. You could have been a lottery pick last year, as well, so talk about your thought process last year and now going into the draft, and the fact that you made the right choice this year?   JAMES HARDEN: Well, I thought that if I wasn't ready last year, there were so many things I needed to improve on; just maturing, just becoming a better basketball player and to become a better person, as well, off the court. So I think I made the right decision to come back after my sophomore year. I learned so much more and now I'm here finally.    Q. That bow tie is incredible. Did you do it yourself?  JAMES HARDEN: No. I tried so many times, it wasn't working, so I had my stylist come up to me to give me a lesson to help me do it.   Q. How do you feel about going to Oklahoma City, a very exciting young team, great management, when did they reach out to you and when did you know they were interested?   JAMES HARDEN: I had a pretty good workout there. We spent a lot of time there getting to know one another as far as the head coach and general manager, the whole organization. They have a great young core over there, Russell and Kevin, a few other players I have to go in there with the mind-set of having to work to earn a position on the team.    Q. How does your game fit into the NBA, your strengths?   JAMES HARDEN: I think I can create my own shots and I definitely like to create for others, as you've seen at Arizona State. Just having the floor open and playing along with other great players, it makes the game that much easier.   Q. Did you feel follow the reports during the workouts, there were some reports that came out that people were kind of down on you; did you listen to any of that?  JAMES HARDEN: No. I think I had a lot of -- I had five workouts and I think all of my workouts have been pretty good. Some I shot the ball better than others but for the most part I handled myself well. Just tried to go in and do my best.    Q. What do you feel the difference will be playing at the professional level?   JAMES HARDEN: Arizona State, there's a lot more going on. But it helps me focus in Oklahoma. You're going to have to focus and know that this is a business and I have to be ready. Because as fast as I got here, I can be out the same.   So like I said, having to go in and work and compete.    Q. Following up to what he just said, it is a business, and it's quite an honor to be the third pick in the NBA Draft but there's no endorsement deals in Oklahoma City. Is that something that bothers you?  JAMES HARDEN: No. If you're winning, then all that stuff comes. That's not my mindset. My mindset is to go in there and work and try to get better every single day and help those guys.   Q. Did you talk to Blake about life in Oklahoma?  JAMES HARDEN: I told him we should switch, he should go to Oklahoma and I should go to L.A. and everything would be great. (Laughter) Obviously it doesn't work that way.   Q. Your game is very refined, so do you think that will help you get instant success and be able to make a contribution?  JAMES HARDEN: Definitely. It helps just going to the hole to look for a foul or shooting three-pointers, it helps me a lot. Last two and a half months I've been working on that and I have a lot of confidence in it now and a lot more to go. A lot more work has to be put into it, but that's another aspect of our game that improves and I still have a lot more to go.  \"}, 'Tyler Hansbrough': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=57439', 'text': \"Q. It's funny, I saw Roy Hibbert out there with the Pacers, you seem to be a small market guy. And Indianapolis is one of the smaller ones in the NBA, is that a good fit?  TYLER HANSBROUGH: I think so. I'm very excited to be out there. I think I fit in well. I'm a Midwest guy from around the area, and so I'm looking forward to it.    Q. How surprised were you, where were the indications of where you thought you might go?   TYLER HANSBROUGH: Well, I had a really good workout for them, and I was kind of talking to my agent, they thought, you know, at one point they might try to go little and you know, try to get a guard or something like that.   It seemed like two minutes before the pick happened, he got a call and he gave me thumbs up and that's when everything changed. The feeling, the emotions of it going through me are kind of undescribable. I was very happy.    Q. Larry Bird being probably the hardest worker in the history of the NBA, talk about what you learned from him? And Troy Murphy being such a skilled player in the inside-outside game; talk about what you can learn from Troy in the court?   TYLER HANSBROUGH: Troy is very skilled and can do a lot of different things. He's versatile. I think I can learn under a guy like that and be able to, you know, come in there and he can teach me some things.   But also, Larry Bird, it doesn't get any better than that. Playing under a Hall of Fame guy, that's what it's all about.    Q. What questions did you have to answer NBA teams as far as your game went?   TYLER HANSBROUGH: You know, for me, it was always just about going there and doing what I do. The media people were always questions my athleticism, how tall is he really, the measurements, me going to these workouts, I think that really helped my stock, and that's where I proved a lot of people wrong.    Q. Talk about you have been a guy that literally from the beginning of the process has been on the defense trying to defend why you should be here or why you're the lottery pick; is it going to be a good point for you not to have to be on the defense every day now?  TYLER HANSBROUGH: You know, it seems like a lot of relief, but it's good going into the lottery, but still, I'm concerned what I do after.   That's more important to me, and I'm looking forward to still proving people wrong and going out there and playing my game.  \"}, 'Blake Griffin': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=57427', 'text': \"Q. Now that we've got this NBA business aside, two quick business questions. Have you signed an apparel endorsement deal, and choosing an agent, was that like Jerry Maguire or how did that work?  BLAKE GRIFFIN: I have not signed an apparel deal yet. We are working on that and should be done sometime soon.   When I chose my agent, I kind of had a relationship from the beginning. A family friend kind of referred me, got to know them pretty well and that's how I did that.    Q. You were selected by the L.A. Clippers, a very tough team with a lot of big guys. How do you see yourself fitting into the team?  BLAKE GRIFFIN: Hopefully I can bring something they don't have. I know they have a lot of great players but at the same time I'm excited about the opportunity and hopefully I can bring something to the table that they don't have or maybe they need.    Q. Is it intimidating going to the town where you're going to? The Lakers are obviously the premiere team in the market right now; is it a relief being able to sit in the background and maybe not have all of the focus on you?  BLAKE GRIFFIN: It is. You can kind of -- when nobody expects you to do something, you have time to work and you have time to build. Hopefully that's what we'll do, and hopefully over the next year or two years, whatever it is, make playoff pushes and become a team that is regularly in the postseason.    Q. Reaction ongoing to the Clippers?   BLAKE GRIFFIN: A little bit. But at the same time, I didn't want to really think about it until it was actually done. I didn't let myself -- I'm happy to be there and I'm excited about the opportunity and looking forward to it.    Q. Can you take us through the moment when they called your name and what it was like with everybody leaning over and the lights flashing?   BLAKE GRIFFIN: It was crazy. I mean, when he came out, I felt my heart start to beat real fast. Going up there, it was a little overwhelming, everybody is yelling, everybody is cheering and stuff, and it was great. I'm just glad they didn't boo me.    Q. I wanted to ask you, how eager were you knowing that everyone knew you were going to be the first pick overall in the Draft; how eager were you to get started as a pro?  BLAKE GRIFFIN: Very eager. This past couple of weeks I've been running around all over the place doing a lot of different things. I really just want to get down to business and start working, because that's what I believe in and that's what I'm about.    Q. Blake, now that you're the No. 1 overall pick, how much of your success can you attribute to playing with Taylor in college?   BLAKE GRIFFIN: A lot. He's prepared me for a lot, and being able to see him go through some situations that I went through, in high school and even when I first got to college and all that, it helped me how to handle it. He pushed me in the right ways and he always knew to tell me what I needed to hear, not what I wanted to hear.    Q. Summer plans, conditioning, personal, Summer League, what are you going to do for the next few months?  BLAKE GRIFFIN: I'm going be to be working out as hard as I can. You know, Summer League, I'll be there, and I'm also going to the USA trials at the end of July in Vegas.   After that, I'm not really sure.    Q. Have you had a chance to speak to any players so far?  BLAKE GRIFFIN: Baron Davis was in the facility when I was there for my workout and I talked to him a little bit. DeAndre Jordan and Eric Gordon were both in my high school class and I already know them. I talk to DeAndre a lot.   Q. Is it tough to change a culture as a rookie; 30 years of losing in an organization, is it going to take time?  BLAKE GRIFFIN: It's definitely going to take time and it's not all about me. I feel like they have a great group of players that can do it, and I'm happy to be a part of that. I'm looking forward to it. I know what's happened in the past, everybody keeps telling me that, but you know, I'm not going to say, okay, we haven't had that many winning seasons, why don't we give up now.    Q. Have you spoken to Donald Sterling?  BLAKE GRIFFIN: No, I haven't talked to him at all.  \"}, 'Jonny Flynn': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=57431', 'text': 'Q. I wanted to ask you two questions: What have your reactions been and how do you feel about playing with those guys in the backcourt?  JONNY FLYNN: You know, it\\'s been a crazy ride over the past two months. I shot up the draft boards when I first said I was coming out, late in the first round, just good workouts and a good showing at the NBA Draft Combine. So it was definitely a roller coaster ride from then, people telling you that you should stay in school and they tell you you\\'re making the wrong decision and to now.  I think going to Minnesota, it\\'s a great organization and a great fit for me. You\\'ve got Kevin Love and Jefferson; two, big men that can make my life easier. I can get them the ball in situations where they can score and they can make me a better player.   Q. Do you think you\\'ll play 48 minutes a game?  JONNY FLYNN: If that\\'s what they need me to do, I played 20 over times a few months ago, so I think I can do that.   Q. Did you see them play on television at all?  JONNY FLYNN: I haven\\'t seen them play on TV, but you see highlights and things like that.   Q. Are you surprised they got Rubio?  JONNY FLYNN: You see the NBA going to a format with two point guards. That\\'s what the game is shifting to. It\\'s good to have two facilitators that can make plays on the course. I think we can boost each other\\'s level of play and I can\\'t wait to go play with him.   Q. So having Rubio alongside, does not concern you at all?  JONNY FLYNN: You\\'re just a basketball player out there, whether you\\'re playing with a superstar, Kobe Bryant or James, they are going to have the ball most of the time anyway. But with two of you, you know you don\\'t have the pressure on to you do everything, so it\\'s going to be great.   Q. What adjustments are you going to make from the college game?  JONNY FLYNN: I think just getting back and playing man-to-man defense. Two years at Syracuse, we didn\\'t play a whole lot of man-to-man and I\\'m ready to go into the NBA and show that I can play man-to-man defense and my athleticism and quickness makes up for my little body.   Q. Did you have a feeling you were fated to play for Minnesota?  JONNY FLYNN: Yeah, I don\\'t know, it might be a little cold for me.    Q. Are you going to insist on a no-Sunbelt team in your contract?  JONNY FLYNN: No, whatever happens, happens. It\\'s just good to be in the organization like this, weather permitting, anything like that. I\\'m just happy to be in an organization that fits my style of play.   Q. And will you give Rubio some cold weather tips? He doesn\\'t seem to be as happy as you are.   JONNY FLYNN: He\\'s coming from Spain, I don\\'t think it ever snows over there. I can give him what kind of clothes to buy and what snowshoes to buy and things like that and it will be fun.    Q. What had Minnesota said to you? Did this take you by surprise?   JONNY FLYNN: You know, they just said that I was really high on their draft board, but a lot of teams tell you that. A lot of teams don\\'t really show their cards until the night of the Draft. So you\\'ve kind of sort of got to take what these teams are saying out one ear and through the other because they could be telling four, five, six different players the same thing.  The one time you can tell if a team is serious is when they pick you and I guess Minnesota was really high on me.   Q. Is this a good time for a guy with your size and skill set to be coming into the NBA, with the way the game is changing?   JONNY FLYNN: I think so. You look at guys like Chris Paul, you look at Aaron Brooks in the past playoffs, guys like that have really dominated the basketball game. When I see that, I kind of throw my hands up in the air and say, \"yay for the little guy.\"   What definitely made it easier for me to come into the NBA without so many skeptical questions at the end of the day.   Q. Do you see yourself getting into a competition with Ricky or can you complement each other?   JONNY FLYNN: I don\\'t think it can be competition. We are playing for the same goal and that\\'s to win an NBA championship. I think we can go in there and we can compromise, where he may have the ball or where I may have the ball. I think it\\'s going to be fun to have another player who can make plays just like you.   Q. Is there a particular coach or style of play you would like to see?   JONNY FLYNN: Me being a guy that likes to get up-and-down the floor, if you ask any point guard they want to be in a system that runs. I think the style of play that definitely fits me is up tempo, a game that\\'s pushing the ball up the court and getting the shots up in quick time.    Q. Your teammate in Niagara Falls, Paul Harris, how much are you looking forward to hearing his name?  JONNY FLYNN: I\\'m looking forward to that, he\\'s a guy that showed many improvements in a short amount of time since the season was over. I can\\'t wait till he gets drafted. I\\'m going to give him a big call and tell him he made it.  '}, 'Christian Eyenga': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=57444', 'text': \"Q. Christian, playing with a player as great as a LeBron James, what do you look forward to learning from playing with a guy with his type of skills?   CHRISTIAN EYENGA: It's a pleasure, of course, and a shock basically to be drafted as high as number 30. I'm very much looking forward to being on the same floor with someone as talented as LeBron James.    Q. As a 6-5 wing player that you are, what are the key assets or abilities you think you'll bring to the team?   CHRISTIAN EYENGA: The main thing will be I'm going to help the team with defense. I'm going to run and I'm going to work as hard as possible to help the team with anything that's going to be necessary.    Q. How nervous were you that you are the 30th and final pick in the first round?   CHRISTIAN EYENGA: When I saw the camera, I wasn't sure it was going to be me. To me, it was a shock, basically. I thought they were filming other players because there were other players waiting to be called up.   I was very, very tense and nervous.    Q. Do you know anything about the city of Cleveland?   CHRISTIAN EYENGA: I knows that it gets very cold, but I hope it's not going to be that cold.  \"}, 'Tyreke Evans': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=57432', 'text': \"Q. Are you looking forward to doing more work with corporate entities?  TYREKE EVANS: I'm looking forward to doing more things with them. I'm pretty good friends with John Starks, so after I get situated, my brother will talk to him and hopefully we can work something out.    Q. Can you talk about the one thing that you have to work on going into Sacramento?   TYREKE EVANS: Just my shooting ability and I think everything else, I'm just going to work hard every day, just try to get my shot better.    Q. Is there a particular position you prefer to play, shooting guard, point guard?  TYREKE EVANS: Not really. A lot of coaches ask me that question a lot, point guard or shooting and I tell them I'm a basketball player. I can play both positions and I'll go to Sacramento and play wherever they want me to play.    Q. You played for Memphis and that's one of the few cities where the college game is more popular than the pro game. Are you surprised from a business decision that they didn't select --  TYREKE EVANS: I think they wanted a big man that could help them out on defense. I mean, I would love to go there. It's like my second home, went to school there.   The games we go to in the morning, they will be sold out and come to a Grizzly game and there will be only a little bit of people in the stands. I probably could have got more people in (laughter).   Q. When you signed with Memphis, did you have in your mind that you played there one year and did Coach Calipari's leaving, what impact did that have?  TYREKE EVANS: That have a lot of impact. I was thinking of staying another year and he told me he was going to Kentucky and he thought I should put my name in the Draft and get a chance to see where I was at. It worked out good and I won't turn back now.   Q. How much better of a player are you now? What have you learned from him that's helped, things you've learned?  TYREKE EVANS: I learned a lot of things on and off the court. He stayed with me every day in practice even though I was a veteran on the team. He made me a better shooter on the court, taking better shots and things like that. He just helped me out a lot.    Q. You went to work out for Sacramento, twice?  TYREKE EVANS: Yes.    Q. First time against nobody. Who was it against the second time, and what did they tell you that might have made you think that they were going to take you?   TYREKE EVANS: I worked out the first time, I think I did pretty good. I was knocking down shots. That was the knock on me coming into the Draft was that my shot wasn't that good and they seen that I could shoot the ball and the second time they wanted me to come work out with some guards and I told them I would do it. They said I was stronger over a lot others there.    Q. Who did you work out with?  TYREKE EVANS: Jonny Flynn, Stephen Curry.    Q. One question I wanted to ask you, Jason Thompson and Spencer, two up-and-coming big men, how much do you look forward to playing with them and that inside-outside game?   TYREKE EVANS: Like you said, two good big men that are young. I've seen them play a lot on the AAU circuit, so I think I will go in there and help kick down some baskets.    Q. This is something that you've been working for since you were seven years old. What is it like to have this moment finally be here?   TYREKE EVANS: It's crazy. I mean, I dreamed, like you said, since I was seven years old watching all the NBA games, I was a fan of Tim Hardaway and that's what I grew up watching. And now that I'm here, it's just big.    Q. Can you comment on the reaction?   TYREKE EVANS: It's just crazy. I've been getting it a lot, but now they call me mister and I ain't ever heard nobody call me mister.  \"}, 'DeMar DeRozan': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=57435', 'text': \"Q. Athleticism is superb and I know the other parts of your game you need to work on -- can you elaborate on those parts, and second question, are you looking forward to be contesting in the slam dunk contest against LeBron?  DEMAR DEROZAN: What I need to work on is what I have been working on since I got out of college, ball handling, shooting, defense, I want to work on everything so at the end of the day I can be the all-around player that I need to be and everything. Definitely.   I've got one more victory in me to do the dunk contest, everything, so it will be great to go up against LeBron James.    Q. Quick question for you: Just talk about the process a little bit about when did you think you were maybe going to Toronto, there was a lot of talk obviously in Toronto about some other options; I know you came in for an individual work out. Just take us through the process.   DEMAR DEROZAN: Toronto showed a lot of interest and everything, so I try to stay open-minded and everything and might go before, might wait till Toronto. But I really felt that they really wanted me and I'm glad that I went right to the Toronto Raptors.    Q. The other thing is sort of in terms of the style of play; are you familiar with how the Raptors played towards the end of last season; where do you see where you are receive fitting into that system?  DEMAR DEROZAN: You know, I think I can fit in great. I can bring a lot to the team on both ends. Probably be defense and offense, that's my thing I try to bring and just get the team going again. Just try to do the little things that need to be done that wasn't done this year and make the team better.    Q. You may be happy going to Toronto, but is your agent happy? The Canadian tax system is pretty onerous.   DEMAR DEROZAN: He's glad for me to go to a team like this. I think this is one of the best situations for me everything and at the end of the day, that's something we are figuring out about the tax system and everything, so right now I am just enjoying.    Q. Are you going to save all the receipts?  DEMAR DEROZAN: Definitely, I've got to save all the receipts. That's one thing I'm going to do.    Q. Quick question just in terms of the city itself; did you get much time to spend looking around when you were up last time?  DEMAR DEROZAN: Definitely, I was up there about a day and a half, great town, ate, seen the city and it was beautiful. It reminded me of a mini-New York, a lot of people walking around, a big city. It was great.    Q. Going to Toronto and playing with Chris Bosh, this is a team that expects to be in the playoffs next year, how do you feel like you'll contribute?   DEMAR DEROZAN: Going in and giving my all on both ends, go out there and try to win every game and never slack a bit. Coming in, you know, might be able to have a chance to come in and try to make an impact and that's one of my main goals is try to get us to that point.  \"}, 'Austin Daye': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=57441', 'text': \"Q. Congratulations, I wanted to ask you, there's been questions about your toughness, so talk about things that you have to prove as well as the work you have to put in to be able to bang inside and not just be dependent on the outside game.   AUSTIN DAYE: Well, first off, toughness, I think I'm going to a team that's very tough and a lot is going to be asked of me and I wouldn't have been drafted unless they thought I was a tough kid because it's a tough town to play in front of.    Q. I know you're looking forward to summer this year because all of that cap room Detroit has; tell us how you're looking forward to playing with players like that?  AUSTIN DAYE: Yeah, star players and great players, and I would love to play with any of those guys, they are great talent. I'm just happy to be a Detroit Piston.    Q. Just tell us the benefits of having a dad that played in the league.   AUSTIN DAYE: I was able to be a sponge growing up, absorb all the things that he said. He's been a great mentor and he's definitely the person I looked up to the most.    Q. Detroit is not the Detroit I remember growing up, General Motors obviously fighting to survive and Chrysler in the same position. When you're playing for a basketball team in obviously a town that's going through some very difficult economic times, does it put more pressure on you guys as entertainers to get people's minds off of their troubles?   AUSTIN DAYE: Yes and no. I think that the Detroit area will definitely come through. But also I think as entertainers, as basketball players, we definitely have to do something to uplift the fans spirits, and I think that's something that we can do.   Q. Tayshaun, how can he help you?   AUSTIN DAYE: Tayshaun being on that team, I'm definitely going to ask him lots of questions, things I can do.  As you can see, he's maybe a frail guy, but he's played six straight years without missing a game. So he's definitely tough, so I'm definitely going to have to listen to him and get some advice.   Q. Tell me about the Gonzaga program and the legacy going on, just talk about how special is it to contribute to that?  AUSTIN DAYE: It was a special experience over there. I was very fortunate. I picked the right school. I definitely think that that program is definitely on the up rise there. I definitely would look for them to be in the Final Four very soon.   Q. Have you been in touch with Adam Morrison at all? He was associated with Gonzaga basketball. He's had a tough NBA career. What has he told you?   AUSTIN DAYE: I haven't talked to Adam a lot. He's in L.A.. I definitely talk to Roy, a lot, he's one of my older brothers, I would say. He's a tough guy and I definitely like to work out with him in the off-season, which is right now for him. I just hope all is well over there in Golden State for him.    Q. Long time since Draft lottery, from there to here. Where do you think you would go?  AUSTIN DAYE: I was confident in myself. I felt the way I played in the combine and also the workouts, I thought I could go in the Top 15. That's why I put my name in the Draft. I wouldn't have otherwise.    Q. With Tayshaun Prince and you having such similar body styles, is that a role model for you to follow?  AUSTIN DAYE: Definitely, he's from the L.A. area, kind of the same things. He's definitely someone I'm going to ask a lot of questions and be a sponge and soak up whatever information he can give me.    Q. Have you talked to Rodney?  AUSTIN DAYE: No, I haven't talked to Rodney. I saw him I think my junior year in high school, and he was definitely doing very well for himself over in Eastern Washington. He's a good player.  \"}, 'Stephen Curry': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=57433', 'text': 'Q. Wanted to ask you how does it feel to play in a backcourt with Monta Ellis and Stephen Jackson, that all three of you could do anything offensively. Talk about how exciting that could be.   STEPHEN CURRY: It\\'s dangerous. I think for an opponent to come in with three guys who can be scoring threats; I know those guys, and the teammates, as well, all three have a potential to get rebound, push it in transition, work off each other, and it\\'s going to be funny think to get in that kinds of system.   Q. Ellis has stated he\\'s interested in staying at point guard. Would you be willing to move to shooting guard if that was the case?  STEPHEN CURRY: Definitely. That\\'s a benefit to my college career; I played both positions for an extended period of time and know how to do both. Either way, I\\'m going to have learn how to do the NBA, but I have experience with it and whatever the team needs me to do, that\\'s what I have to do.    Q. Just talk about how it all went down, and just what you thought was going to happen and then how it did happen and you were very close to going to New York but didn\\'t, or were you really because you know --  STEPHEN CURRY: I came into tonight not knowing what was going to happen besides Blake going No. 1.  Other than that, once Minnesota took two point guards, I saw the fit that was there in Golden State when I realized that it would make sense to pick me there. And wasn\\'t surprised at all that they did.   Close to New York and moved on past that opportunity and ready to go.    Q. It looked like once the picks were off the board and it came down to Golden State, or the Knicks, were you putting your hands together that they were going to pick someone else, or you dipped your head for a second?  STEPHEN CURRY: That was me dipping my head. That was just a little way of thanking him for this opportunity. It wasn\\'t anything about not going to New York or a disappointment or anything like that.   Q. You had not made any secret your desire to play in New York; any twinge of disappointment?  STEPHEN CURRY: I left that all yesterday, once the Draft day comes and you know anything can happen, you can\\'t go in biased towards one team or anything like that and try to let yourself down. Came with an open mind and just take whatever happens and go with it.   Q. Coach Don Nelson can be unpredictable with minutes. How are you preparing?   STEPHEN CURRY: Last three days, I had Coach McKillop playing 40 minutes a game [] I\\'m going to to adjust to that if that\\'s how it goes down. I\\'m willing to show him I\\'m willing to work and hopefully it won\\'t be a problem. I guess you take each instance and each situation and just make the best of it. I don\\'t think it will be a problem.    Q. Your mom had a pretty cool sign in the Green Room. Is there any story behind it?  STEPHEN CURRY: The \"hi, Davidson\" one? Just remembering where I came from, my teammates and all of them are having a big party back at Davidson and celebrating. I don\\'t know if it made the camera or not but that was just our way of saying hi to the community back there that\\'s meant so much to me the last few years and just showing I\\'m still wearing Davidson on my heart even though I have a Golden State hat on now.    Q. You\\'re the only All-American to be considered a legacy at the school. Why do you feel now was the right time to leave for the NBA?  STEPHEN CURRY: Just me feeling ready for it and knowing that I can really contribute on the next level right away. Don\\'t want to come in, I guess, prepared for what I\\'m about to experience.  Stay my junior year and develop my mental toughness throughout the season helped prepare me for what I wanted to do at that point.   Q. Knowing that your dad played in the NBA, did you have it in your mind at an early age that you wanted to do the same thing?  STEPHEN CURRY: You always dream that you want to do what your dad does, especially I went to the gym, shoot around, the locker room and all that stuff and that\\'s all I knew. I wanted to follow in his foot steps but I didn\\'t think it would be a reality until pretty much my sophomore year in college that this could actually happen.   But growing up, definitely you want to do what your dad does.    Q. Is there going to be an \"I Love College\" remix?   STEPHEN CURRY: I\\'m going to have to invite all my friends from Davidson to Golden State to maybe mix a song about the new team.    Q. What do you know really good Golden State? Have you ever been to that arena, just about the team and Nelson, very much, or not very much at all?  STEPHEN CURRY: Very vaguely. I know a couple of players, Jackson and Ellis and Coach Don Nelson. I know their style of play is up-and-down. Other than that, I know the city pretty well. It\\'s going to be a Brand new experience with a different coach. It\\'s going to be a quick learning curve for me.  '}, 'Darren Collison': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=57442', 'text': \"Q. Talk about how much you have to prove because you felt under the radar even though you had a decorated college clear, talk about how much you feel you have to prove that make sure you let the doubters and haters know?  DARREN COLLISON: If you understood the emotion when you're in this chair right now, you wouldn't matter about what anybody says. I really don't care what anybody says about my past.   I did what I had to do for UCLA. It was a project I was trying to build and unfortunately we didn't win the National Championship last year, but as of right now, I'm blessed, to be part of one of the best point guards in the league and arguably one of the best point guards ever, I feel really blessed and fortunate.    Q. The defense will help you be able to have a long career in the league, right?  DARREN COLLISON: Yeah, you can speak to the other guys, as well, like Russell, Luke, everybody else, they will tell you the same thing. Coach Howland, he gets you ready for the future and defensively, he doesn't play. Every day he emphasizes the defense and I'm just happy to be part of this experiment. I don't really know what to tell you right now because I'm a little high on the clouds but I'm just happy to be here and I'm just glad that Coach Howland did what he could to make me a great player.   Q. Going to New Orleans, have you seen New Orleans or been to a Hornets game, and how do you feel about going to an organization with a fan base as rabid as they are?  DARREN COLLISON: I haven't really seen New Orleans or been to a New Orleans game. I worked out for them one time. It's a great city and they have a great team, I can tell you that. I watched them play numerous times.  Like I said, one person you think of on the New Orleans Hornets is Chris Paul, and he's one of the best point guards so I'm going to soak in the knowledge he has to say everything and he says on the court and absorb that. Byron Scott is a good guy. I was working out with him and it was all towards me, my parents are track athletes and I was all good for it. I worked on my endurance this whole off-season and it paid off.    Q. Being a four-year player, what do you think are going to be the key assets that you bring to the Hornets organization?  DARREN COLLISON: Maturity. Being at UCLA is not just any school. It's a high-profile school, too. Being there for four years, I just remember charity. I could come in and produce right away and I think that's what they were looking for in their second string. I'm looking forward to making big things and being accepted into a family and not like I'm going in there to be a big shot. It's not like I have to learn from everybody else.  There's still a lot of learning to do but once I get on the court, whether it's practice, off-season training camp, I should be fine.    Q. You were one of the guys in the Green Room, did you have a promise or know that you were going this high? It seemed like it surprised some people.   DARREN COLLISON: Actually, no, I really didn't until right now. My parents, they wanted to go to New York and experience this whole process. So I really didn't know how high I was going to go, but I had kind of a range, but it wasn't promising or anything.   You know, I found like like ten seconds before I got picked, it was definitely suspense-feeling, because you don't know what's going to happen and who the players are going to be taking, but it's a good experience for the players who participate in this Draft.   Q. Do you feel confident that staying the fourth year was a good decision for you then?  DARREN COLLISON: Definitely, right here behind Chris Paul, I have a chance to learn from him. Later on in my future, I can emulate those things and those things he taught me in my future. I definitely feel it's a good situation and I owe it to my coaching staff and that's why I stayed and I'll be loyal to the team that drafted me, too.    Q. I wanted to ask you one more question about the Pac-10, so much talent over the past four years during your time there. Talk about how that's preparing you, that level of competition is preparing you for the league?  DARREN COLLISON: Oh, man, you seen last year how many players went in the Pac-10 and what they are doing right now in the NBA. Enough about that. The Pac-10 brings it every day. There's never an off-night in that league. Every player is capable of doing something special at the next level. And like I said, I was just definitely fortunate to be part of that as being a three-year starter.  The Pac-10 is always going to get you ready, later on down the road as far as the other players coming up. But right now, for me, it's definitely put me in this position.   Q. College basketball is is very structured and systematic. Do you feel that your game is going to translate into the iso-NBA game?  DARREN COLLISON: Definitely, I can't wait to go on to the court and show people what I can do. College basketball, it's clogged up and you really can't do much. It's more of a team play. I was doing good playing with my team and we had a great team that won a lot of games being there at UCLA.  Now in the NBA it's more spaced out and it's all to your athleticism and I definitely fit in that category and I'm definitely excited for this next level.  \"}, 'Rodrigue Beaubois': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=57443', 'text': \"Q. If you could talk about your style of play to start with.   RODRIGUE BEAUBOIS: Style of play, I would say I can run. I would like to run, so for the NBA, I think it's a good thing.   After that, I think I can do a couple other things, like I can shoot the ball. I can make the others better. So that's it.    Q. What are you going to do to prepare yourself for the physical rigors of the NBA season?   RODRIGUE BEAUBOIS: Yeah, I think I need to work on my body, for sure. So I think I don't know, maybe next week I'm going to start to work on weightlifting, things like that, run. I really want to be ready for the beginning of the season.   So I will prepare myself to be ready.  \"}}, 2010: {'Hassan Whiteside': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=64437', 'text': \"Q. What are your thoughts?  HASSAN WHITESIDE: I would like to thank the Kings for drafting me, first off, and I plan on bringing to the game defense and offense and rebounding and just become a great player overall and make the team better.    Q. You're going to be playing behind Samuel Dalembert, very defensive presence in the middle, talk about what you're looking forward to learning from him. Second question is do you feel you should have waited another year, because you were projected to be a lottery pick; do you think you should have waited or did you make the right choice?   HASSAN WHITESIDE: I can't really tell the future, all the coaching staff at Marshall left, so it would have been different. My future at the Kings, I feel like it's a good organization that I always wanted to play for.   Q. You have six blocks a game; do you think with your defensive presence that can get you minutes instantly?  HASSAN WHITESIDE: Yes, sir. I plan on just coming in and playing hard and making the team better.  \"}, 'John Wall': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=64429', 'text': 'Q. The Washington Wizards organization had a tough year, definitely so. How are you looking forward to really creating a new chapter in that organization and making an impact?   JOHN WALL: Thank you for saying congratulations but first of all, like Kentucky, we went in with a new group of guys and I know this is a different level, but I just have to go in and show those guys I\\'m willing to work and listen as much as I can and be a leader. That\\'s the key is being a leader and trying to help them win games.   Q. What lessons can you learn from your Kentucky experience that will help you with the wizards?   JOHN WALL: First of all, the fans, it\\'s crazy, but as a maturity level, Coach taught me a lot and I became a better leader vocally. I was always a leader by example being the first in the gym and last in the gym and working hard, but I\\'m a leader that won\\'t mind speaking up to the older guys.    Q. When you Tweeted your dream was about to come true, that you had since you were a kid, what was it like for you when you went on the stage?   JOHN WALL: I was emotional, almost brought tears to my eyes. A couple years I had to sit back in the room watching LeBron and Derrick Rose and Tyreke and those guys and going up and shaking hands with David Stern means a lot.   Q. Do you feel any added pressure being the consensus No. 1 pick?  JOHN WALL: I feel like I had pressure since I became No. 1 in high school and was one of the top players. I always got there hungry wanting to fight hard and compete in every game so when I step on the court I\\'m going to take on any challenge there.   Q. I notice you never smiled all the way up and shook the Commissioner\\'s hand and he said something and you broke into a big grin. Why didn\\'t you smile to start with and what did he say?  JOHN WALL: It was an emotional experience. I was happy to be in the situation and I said -- he said, \"You were waiting for this, weren\\'t you.\" It was a great time to sit there and shake his hands in front of all those people out there and the rest of the prospects means a lot.   Q. They are not sure what they are going to do with Gilbert Arenas, but how do you feel you can play with each other?   JOHN WALL: I feel like he needs the ball in his hands a lot but he did a great job with the point guard and we both did a great job this year and both have a chance to reach our dreams.    Q. Congratulations, I just want to ask your opinion about playing for an owner who thrives on building his team via draft picks and what that\\'s going to be like for you.   JOHN WALL: That means a lot. It means he\\'s going out there and trying to start up brand new and build the team from all over again and let\\'s hope it\\'s with me and some other guys picked this year, just hope we change the organization around on and off the court.    Q. Just talk about this what will be the greatest challenge, will it be on the court or rejuvenating the fan base?  JOHN WALL: I thought it was going to be the fan base but I feel like if you support them in their city, they are going to be there. The main thing is being on the court and learning so much, it\\'s a different game and different speed and I\\'ve been grinding hard this whole summer waiting and preparing for it, we have to wait and see.   Q. Do you think you\\'ll get invited to the White House for a couple pick-up games?  JOHN WALL: I asked him to play one-on-one H.O.R.S.E. and I will try to ask him again.   Q. So you have spoken?   JOHN WALL: We haven\\'t spoken but he talked to our whole Kentucky team.   Q. You can\\'t wear 11, it\\'s been retired. What number are you going to have?   JOHN WALL: I don\\'t know yet. I\\'m sitting down with my team and my family and going to try to decide.    Q. Your defense is very underrated. Talk about how you\\'re looking to even increase that and be a possible perennial all-defensive team.   JOHN WALL: Basically, you know, just working hard, working on my footwork and giving 100% of the defense and not just giving 100% on offense. That\\'s the key with my jumpshot, too, being more consistent and confident, too, and that\\'s one thing I feel like I need to work on was my jumpshot and defense and that\\'s why I\\'m going to try to show people I can play and knock down the shot.   Q. You hugged your mother, a very motional moment. Talk about the impact she\\'s had and especially on in a day like this.   JOHN WALL: I can\\'t even -- words can\\'t even explain right now. Growing up I lived in a tough neighborhood, getting in trouble in school, especially when my dad passed. So my mom taking me to school and picked up in the afternoon, that was it. As a kid, 10, 11 years old, you want to see your family spend time and didn\\'t really have it. She was the first lady, she says, if you don\\'t change your attitude, you\\'ll never be doing so for her, to be in some situation, means a lot to me and I love her to death.   Q. You were cut from your high school team; was this moment in doubt for you?   JOHN WALL: Never in doubt. Luckily I watched the tape where Michael Jordan got cut. If he can get cut, it\\'s not too bad for me to get cut.   Q. How do you think you will fit into the offensive system, pick-and-roll oriented?   JOHN WALL: I think I can play the pick-and-roll well, we did a great job in Kentucky and most of the NBA is off pick-and-roll or you get a fast break or unless you have an all-star type player, you get on one-on-one situations, so I think I\\'ll do good.    Q. How productive do you think you can be right away in that first season?   JOHN WALL: I think I can be very productive. Just got to have that confidence in working on your game. If you think you can do the right things at the next level, just going and having the confidence to play. If you have a coach like Coach Saunders will give you the opportunity to play and make a couple of mistakes and they can teach you at the same time and help you out.   Q. How did the difficult times prepare you for facing adversity on the court?   JOHN WALL: It helps me a lot. What people said about me don\\'t really get to me as much. I\\'m used to hearing it because I was bad, so doesn\\'t get to me; I use it as motivation. As soon as somebody say something negative, I want to build off it. I don\\'t let it get to my head.   Q. Do you have a cause you want to help off the court? Every player usually picks some type of cause that they do like off the court. Do you have a certain cause that you would like to expand on now that you\\'ll be a pro and people will take example from you?   JOHN WALL: The main thing is I love kids so I wouldn\\'t mind having a camp or being able to go to the YMCA and talk to kids. We did an NBA Kids the other day and that meant a lot to me, and as a prospect, I wish I had gotten a chance to see guys at that age.    Q. Last year was not a good year for Washington, a lot of things went bad. How important is it for you to come in and set a new culture and a new tone?   JOHN WALL: It\\'s key, but it\\'s tough, everybody is good on that level. I can\\'t get frustrated if we are not winning that many games or go on a 0-10 losing streak, you just have to stay confident and trust in your teammates. In that level, it\\'s different than high school or college, you might lose a couple of games in a row. So just stick together and keep your team together.    Q. You might go back out there and watch four of your teammates get drafted in the first round; what does that mean?   JOHN WALL: That\\'s going to mean a lot. I want everybody to get picked. Once I made Eric and Daniel -- I already told them, y\\'all played okay, you play okay, you have a chance to reach your dream and hopefully tonight is a night all of us can reach our dream in the first round.    Q. Did anybody talk to you about what to expect in NBA life?   JOHN WALL: I\\'m a person that wants to look ahead and stuff and be mature on the next level, so I notice a lot of things that basically you have to spotlight on 24/7 everywhere you go and you have to watch who you surround yourself with.  '}, 'Greivis Vasquez': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=64436', 'text': 'Q. What are your feelings right now?   GREIVIS VASQUEZ: Well, an unbelievable feeling, getting drafted, being in the first round and being one of those 30 guys that, you know, gets selected in the first round, so I\\'m very happy. I\\'m happy that I\\'m going to Memphis. I\\'m happy for the city. I can\\'t wait to get there, start working for training camp and then the fans, I\\'m really going to love them.   I\\'m excited. I\\'m very, very excited.   Q. Talk about being a 6-6 point guard, how that\\'s going to benefit you, as well as the things you need to work on. And second question, the ending with Michigan State was incredible; talk about the excitement of the NCAAs.   GREIVIS VASQUEZ: Being 6\\'6\" is all going to help me in the league. Playing four years with Maryland and the National Championship helped me to gain some experience and maturity. I think I won\\'t have any problems going against point guards and shooting guards. I think I have to work on getting stronger and quicker, and I already feel better. So now that I\\'m focused on basketball 24/7 and don\\'t have no school definitely helps me.  The last college game was really emotional for me, the way we lost against Michigan State, but besides that, my team did a great job coming back. We came back, we were down 20, and then we basically were winning the game the last two seconds, and then the kid made a huge three and beat us at the buzzer.   I still got that game on my mind, and that is when I told myself after we lost. I said I\\'m going to work extremely hard so I win an NBA championship.   Q. You had the moxy to take that big shot, and to make two big shots, as well.   GREIVIS VASQUEZ: I see Ginobili and I see myself, and I love taking those tough shots, and especially when my team needs me to take a big-time shot. So it worked out for me. But it really doesn\\'t matter because we lost but it was a great game overall.   Q. What\\'s the significance of being drafted as the only player from Venezuela?   GREIVIS VASQUEZ: (In Spanish: He\\'s talking about his emotions and how proud he is to represent the people of Venezuela and his family. )   Q. What\\'s impressive about you is the hard work that you\\'ve done over the years, and also, can you talk about your feelings when your name was called?   GREIVIS VASQUEZ: I think what got me here was my work ethic. I had a great journey. I\\'m thankful and I never thought I would be sitting here talking to you guys and being in the NBA.   I\\'m very happy, I\\'m very humble and I just want to continue to work even harder from now on, because I believe that I can win an NBA championship, and it\\'s going to take a lot of work.    Q. Talk about your fan following when your name was called.   GREIVIS VASQUEZ: It was unbelievable. I love the fans and my family and everybody cheering for me. That\\'s something that I do appreciate a lot, and I\\'m thankful about that. I will never let the fans down and I was very thankful and I was shocked. I mean, the fans were rooting hard for me and that means a lot.    Q. I guess I was going to say something along the lines of, there\\'s quite a scene out there with the flags waving; do you expect that national following to continue with you towards Memphis?   GREIVIS VASQUEZ: Well, I wouldn\\'t say that I expect that. But I would say that I would love to have it, and that was great. That was a great feeling, you know, people supporting you, getting you back, that was great. And then just like I say, I\\'m thankful and I\\'m very happy and excited about my pro career.    Q. You and Patrick Patterson are the only people to complete a four-year degree; do you think there\\'s a prejudice against graduates?   GREIVIS VASQUEZ: It\\'s going to help you. I mean, I don\\'t want to take anything away from the other guys. I think the guys that got drafted that were underclassmen, they are great players. No question they are.   But I think playing four years in college gives you more experience and more maturity. So maybe your decision -- no maybe; this is a fact. The decision-making, you know, is a lot better. It will be like an adult making a decision. But you know, when you are extremely talented, you might not have to go for four years, but that\\'s how life is.  For me, it was great for me to go four years in college, being in Maryland with Coach Williams, it really helped me a lot to the point where nobody thought I was going to get drafted the first round, and I am drafted.   Q. We could obviously tell how excited you were; where did you think you might go? A number of teams were very interested in you and the Knicks were one of them. Did you give any thought of where you might end up?   GREIVIS VASQUEZ: I think the Knicks are a great team, no question about that. But when you are sitting right there on the stands and waiting for your name to be called, you just want to get your name called, regardless. I love the team that I just got drafted by. I think the Memphis Grizzlies is really going to give me an opportunity to develop my game. It not going to be easy but I have to work extremely hard, and I\\'m just thankful. It\\'s good. It\\'s great. The whole situation to me seems pretty good. I mean, I\\'m excited about coming in and working hard, and sorry that I couldn\\'t go to the Knicks but I\\'m just happy with the Memphis Grizzlies right now.    Q. Four weeks ago, we sat in Chicago and I asked you the question, are you a first-round draft pick, and no question in your voice, you said you were, without question; how good does it feel to be a first-round draft pick now?  GREIVIS VASQUEZ: Very good. I\\'m going to keep it humble. I really think everything happens for a reason and I thank God for giving me strength. It was hard. I waited 28 picks to get drafted.   I\\'m excited, very excited. After you get drafted, you feel a release that you want to get to work. I\\'m just very excited and I\\'m happy, and I\\'m not going to let the Memphis fans down. I think I\\'m going to bring my energy and my enthusiasm, so I just can\\'t wait to start working out for the team.    Q. Talk about Venezuela is known for baseball, obviously, and talk about how your being picked in the first round and the fact that you can potentially start with the Memphis Grizzlies, how that can propel Venezuela basketball?   GREIVIS VASQUEZ: I mean, I get emotional because my country have been following me and supporting me like I\\'m the best baseball player coming out of Venezuela right now and that\\'s huge. I grew up watching baseball. I\\'m a baseball fan. To see people and young kids following me in my career in college is priceless. It\\'s unbelievable, and that\\'s another motive that I have. My country really pushed me inside of me to get better and just not to let my country down; I think having a chance to play and develop my game in the NBA is going to be huge, huge, for my country, especially because, you know, what we are going through right now. It\\'s going to bring happiness. People want to forget about -- they just want to talk about sports, baseball, basketball, and right now we have a lot of baseball players but only one NBA guy, so I feel good about that.    Q. I know you touched on it before, but how important was it to you to get a degree at Maryland?  GREIVIS VASQUEZ: Unbelievable. I think nobody can take that away from me. Nobody. I mean, to me, it\\'s not about money. To me it\\'s not about fame. To me it\\'s about being a good person and a good basketball player, and I think like I say, I\\'m thankful that I went to Maryland, because the university gave me a chance to become a great person and a great player, and then, you know, winning the NCAA player in the year, best point guard in the country and getting drafted in the first round by the Memphis Grizzlies, I can\\'t ask for anything else.   And now playing six years, I intend on playing in the NBA, now I can go back and have any type of business because I have my degree, so I have some type of knowledge and that\\'s huge.   Q. Coming from Venezuela and being the first basketball player from there, how much does it mean for you to be a role model to get a degree and go to college?   GREIVIS VASQUEZ: I want to be in that position right now. I want kids to understand that. You can only play sports for so long but what happens if you get injured or something goes wrong, and so then you have your backup plan, which is your degree.  That\\'s something that makes me proud and makes my family proud and makes my country proud; and if I did it, kids can do it, too. You need to stay in school and get your degree. That\\'s important.

Talk about going to Golden State, not much of a defensive pedigree there but how are you looking forward to bringing that defensive intensity in the middle while those guards show their offensive promise?   EKPE UDOH: I'm just going to come in with the mindset of playing defense first. It's something that comes easy to me and something that I love to do, block shots and help the team in any way advance.   Q. Are you prepared for Coach Nelson, with the erratic minutes, two minutes or 40 minutes, are you prepared for that?   EKPE UDOH: I wouldn't say I'm prepared now but it's something that you have to grow with, having never been through it. I just have to work with it and I've been to a year where I didn't play a whole year so just got to keep getting better.    Q. Can you talk about specifically what Coach taught you at Baylor?   EKPE UDOH: Just being versatile, being able to be anywhere out on the court and on defense, you know, anchoring the whole team.    Q. Did you have an idea of where you were going to get picked?  EKPE UDOH: I had an idea, my agent told me six to nine, so he calmed my nerves a little bit. Very excited.   Q. Was Golden State in your mind at all?   EKPE UDOH: It was a possibility.    Q. Golden State has a lot of turmoil but there are rumors a lot of change, that it's an unstable organization right now.   EKPE UDOH: I'm just going to go there and work hard. I can't control that stuff.    Q. Do you actually study the geography? Did that enter your mind?   EKPE UDOH: It's not something I don't study, but I know it's a beautiful city and I'm ready for it. It won't be like the winters I had to face in Michigan.    Q. It's been a while since we had a Baylor player standing here and you were a part of bringing them back; talk about being part of the surge of Baylor this year?  EKPE UDOH: I love B-U nation. Coming together, everybody is for Baylor and it's great, we are going to be successful in the years to come and I really believe in Coach and what he's doing.    Q. Elaborate more about Coach Drew as Baylor was pretty much in dark times, like almost a decade ago.   EKPE UDOH: He's just done a great job, everybody bought in and if you get into the system, he's going to love you and take care of you. This year, we really grinded it out for him, and you know, during the tournament, people tried to bring up what happened in the past but we just kept on winning, so, you know, now they are out of the past.  \"}, 'Evan Turner': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=64425', 'text': \"Q. Evan, how do you expect to fit in with the team? Do you think you have to earn minutes right away? Do you expect to be starting or have to fight for your minutes?   EVAN TURNER: You know, just coming from the background, I think that you have to earn everything. I'm definitely ready to earn my minutes and earn my keep, and also, you know, just be part of the team and work hard and play hard.    Q. You've been drafted by Philadelphia, a very, very demanding city, so how are you looking to deal with that pressure that you're going to have coming in?   EVAN TURNER: I don't have any pressure, I don't think. I have a lot of demands from myself, so I'm going to play hard and work hard and I expect myself to be great and Philly especially to be great, and we have a mutual understanding.    Q. How much did Ohio State's style of basketball prepare you for the NBA, and was that also a factor when you chose Ohio State instead of a couple other Big Ten schools thinking that they would prepare you maybe better than other sports?   EVAN TURNER: I think Ohio State style prepared me because Coach Matta wants you to make plays and play hard and that's what the NBA is about, use a lot of pick-and-roll and play-making ability and it's all about toughness and grit.  One thing that turned me on to Ohio State is all of the recruits he was bringing in with Cook and Oden, a lot of competition and a lot of NBA players there and that's what I was thinking, to get me prepared for the future.   Q. If the NBA were not part of your life, what would you want to be doing?   EVAN TURNER: I think definitely helping youth and also people who don't know, I want to learn how to play the acoustic guitar and maybe go on a world tour or something.   Q. Do you have any musical background?   EVAN TURNER: Not at all.   Q. At the lottery, I talked to Jrue Holiday about the potential of playing with you after the Sixers got the No. 2 pick, and he had very high praise and knows your style of play. How much do you know about him, and can you talk about being paired with him?   EVAN TURNER: I know he is kind of like a high school legend on the West Coast. He's well-respected and ambitious and a tremendous competitor and's a big backcourt guard and he's all about winning and he's competitive. He's young and he's only going to get better and I think we can grow together.    Q. Are you ready to guarantee Philly in the playoffs next year?   EVAN TURNER: You can't guarantee anything but I don't think about losing and I expect the playoffs, as well. I'm sure my teammates do, as well. As long as you play hard, everything will be fine.    Q. Give us an idea of your defensive approach and your strengths and weaknesses?   EVAN TURNER: I think you have to -- in regards to defense, I think you have to have an attack mentality on defense. You have to be ready to get down and also be aware, help your teammates out. You know, defense takes a great pride and respect for yourself and I'm ready to defend.    Q. Weaknesses?  EVAN TURNER: I just have to get more consistent in regards to weakness of my game, long-range, and also I think definitely my decision-making can get a little bit better as well.   Q. What can Philadelphia expect right off the bat?   EVAN TURNER: I'm a competitor and hate to lose and I'm a hard worker and versatile.   I think they can expect somebody that means well.    Q. I wondered Philadelphia calmed your nerves before 7:30? I saw David take a call and hand the phone to you. Wonder if you knew this was going to happen before anybody else?   EVAN TURNER: You never stop thinking. Yeah, sort of calmed my nerves a little bit. We talked a little bit about and there was a high possibility they would be selecting me.   Q. Since the Sixers traded Iverson three years ago, it's been a struggle looking for a player to really get excited about; do you think you can be that player to really get the fans back into the team?  EVAN TURNER: I think I have a potential to be, a possibility to be. Once again I think I expect a lot out of myself and I've proven that in the past and I've worked hard. I think the team in general will be really excited. We have some new players and good young players, as well, so should already be excited, new additions, can do a lot of big things this season.    Q. How much are you looking forward to playing with Coach Collins, as a veteran coach, how much are you looking forward to working with him?   EVAN TURNER: I've been looking forward to playing with him all my life. He's been a player that's on top of the game at different stages of the game and coached some of the greatest players of all time and I can't wait to learn from him.   Q. He was drafted by Philly, too.   EVAN TURNER: Yeah, so he knows what it's all about.   Q. John Wall announced a deal with Reebok yesterday and Derrick (Favors) is going with Adidas; will there be something from you in that department soon?  EVAN TURNER: Maybe if somebody wants me, I'll find a spot. (Laughter).   Q. What's the adjustment going to be playing without the bail for --  EVAN TURNER: I'm versatile. It's basketball. I think some people get tied up too much in, well, he hasn't done this and he hasn't done that. If you're a basketball player, you can make anything happen. \"}, 'Kevin Seraphin': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=64430', 'text': \"Q. Wanting to ask about Rodrigue Beaubois who had success in his rookie year, and do you look forward to having success playing against him at the next level?   KEVIN SERAPHIN: He gave me a lot of advice, he's like my best friend, like a brother for me. For sure we talk a lot together and he was giving a lot of advice about the next level, how I need to work and everything.    Q. Talk about how soon you expect to have an impact in the NBA, or how long are you going to be in the NBA?   KEVIN SERAPHIN: When I started to play ball, it was like five years ago, only five years ago.   When I started, I was right away dreaming about playing in the NBA, because it's the best league in the world. And I want to be a good player in the NBA and I have a good feeling with the team in Washington. They told me they really count on me and I'm going to work. I know that I have to work hard now. And to get the opportunity to play with John Wall is going to help me, too, because John Wall is a tremendous player.    Q. Can you just talk about how the Wizards first got in touch with you and your communication with them in the last few months leading up to today?   KEVIN SERAPHIN: I think Washington is probably the team, one of the teams to come to see the matches a lot. They came a lot to France to see me. We got a good communication with the scouts and the GMs of the team. We got a good feeling with this team and that's why when we knew we got a trade and to get the 17th pick, we got a lot of confidence on the Draft.    Q. There's talented, young big men in Washington, and of course you are going to be competing for minutes. So what's your mindset going into Summer League and training camp, etc.?   KEVIN SERAPHIN: I'm going to try to go step-by-step and work to get minutes, because every year, I put some objective, like goals, and I did well every year.    Q. In light of the debacle of the World Cup, do you think basketball will become more popular than soccer in France very quickly?   KEVIN SERAPHIN: Yeah, I expect that the basketball players from France are going to be more popular and basketball is going to have a better place with the media, hopefully. (Laughing).   Q. Can you just talk about your strengths and weaknesses and who would you compare yourself to in the NBA?   KEVIN SERAPHIN: I have a physical -- natural physical ability, like 280 pounds. I don't really lift, you know what I mean? I play rebounds, block shots, toughness. I'm a tough player and strong and use my body for that because I have natural abilities. And I can score. Getting better and better offensively, too.   Q. Which NBA player would you say you resemble?   KEVIN SERAPHIN: Nene in Denver and Al Horford. \"}, 'Tibor Pleiss': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=64450', 'text': \"Q. What are you feelings and what do you think you'll bring to the Nets?   TIBOR PLEISS: I was so excited to be here, and I say thank you and I must say thank you to my parents and my coaches, all the staff, my national coach. It's nice to be here. It's a nice feeling.    Q. Can you describe your basketball game?   TIBOR PLEISS: I am a good defender and I like to shoot the ball, this is what I can do. I think I must fight for my dream. This was one of my dreams to be in the Draft, and I think, yeah, I must work next year for my next dream for the NBA. And at the moment, I play for the German team, but my dream is the NBA.    Q. Do you follow the NBA, and what do you know about the Nets?   TIBOR PLEISS: The Nets, I don't follow the NBAs -- this was a dream. If you ask me for ten players in the NBA, I could maybe say the best players. But the NBA was the best league of the world, and I don't know, this is a dream, it's a dream. I like the sports, the basketball, and I will do everything to be here and to play basketball.    Q. What are your major strengths on the court? What do you bring to the Nets, your assets? How do you classify your strengths or assets, rebounding, scoring, blocked shots?   TIBOR PLEISS: Yeah, blocked shots. I give the best defense that I can and to play good basketball, I think that's my goal.  \"}, 'Patrick Patterson': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=64433', 'text': \"Q. Thoughts?   PATRICK PATTERSON: Right now extremely nervous, shaking on the inside, you know, it's a blessing. It feels great to finally be drafted, a dream come true and now I get to begin a new chapter in my life.    Q. Patrick, congratulations to you, four first round picks so far from UK; talk about how that feels to have such a talented team and all of you guys are very close and fulfilling your dreams. The second question, your decision to go back to UK and play, how that helped you?   PATRICK PATTERSON: As far as all of us being in the Draft, and four of us being drafted so far, you know, it's just a great accomplishment for all of us, individually, and especially for the University of Kentucky Coach Calipari and the coaching staff. Hopefully we can get five. It's been four previously on different teams and hopefully we can set history for Kentucky and make a new milestone and make a five.   Returning last year and playing with Calipari and the rest of my teammates, my decision to do that definitely was fulfilling, improving my game, playing on the perimeter, improving my jumpshot, being more efficient, and working on my shooting mechanics definitely played off throughout the season and just played alongside the great freshman. Playing like veterans every single night and they made my year, they made it a lot more fun and made it more interesting and they just made it a complete ball.    Q. Everyone has been complimenting your character and makeup; what do you attribute that to?  PATRICK PATTERSON: My parents, we had strict rules in the household for punishment and acting wrong. If I wanted to make it to the next level, I had to work hard and enjoy life to the fullest. I definitely thank my family for the way I am now, my character and myself.    Q. Xavier spoke earlier about how at Kansas it humbled him playing less of a major role. Do you think taking a lesser role, that that can help you in the NBA where you are not a key player on the team?  PATRICK PATTERSON: Definitely in high school, I played with O.J. my senior year and that prepared me for the rest of the freshman and by having not to put the entire load on my back and score every single night and realize there's guys better than me and I could take a back seat and unleash them or watch them play; that's going to prepare me for the NBA and work hard and prove myself on the court.  I think definitely playing with John and DeMarcus is going to help me from the standpoint of I've got to work hard to play and prove myself, and also, if I can't play, I'll be fine with it, but everything I went through in my past is going to help me in the future.    Q. What's your major at Kentucky?   PATRICK PATTERSON: Communication and Leadership Development.    Q. I assume you're going to finish up?   PATRICK PATTERSON: Oh, I got the degree.    Q. Even though you were one of the last people, you're playing in a state with no income tax.   PATRICK PATTERSON: That's the first thing that clicked. You know, I feel great. I'm fine. It really didn't matter when my name was called as long as it got called. My goal was to get a hat, and I came here and accomplished it. I came here and I got a hat and I'm extremely excited and happy about what the future holds.    Q. Really impressed with your character; what do you want to do in the league, knowing that you have everything else that a kid needs to have to go into a situation like this? What do you want to do as a basketball player?   PATRICK PATTERSON: As a basketball player on the court, just become one of the best and elite players in the game, improve my game and be a well-representative of the organization on the court and off the court and just prove I can shoot and make All-Star teams and make it to the playoffs and championships and help the organization out in any way possible to become a better team and be more respected in the organization, and in the NBA.    Q. You're going to Houston, city of championships, this is a club that doesn't accept mediocrity. What are you bringing?   PATRICK PATTERSON: Maturity and character off the court, somebody you don't have to worry about and can represent the organization well. And someone who can run up-and-down the court in transition, play offense, defense, score around the rim, hit jumpshots and perimeter shots and somebody who will work extremely hard to be the best player he can be to help the organization.   Q. You have Yao Ming coming back; ever played with anybody close to that big?  PATRICK PATTERSON: Never. Tallest person was DeMarcus, I ever played beside.  When I went there to work out, I worked out and there he was walking behind me and I look straight up and still looking up and he's a tall and big guy. I definitely look forward to playing alongside him and meeting him and developing that relationship.    Q. How often have you watched the Rockets practice today and what are your impressions of the team itself and the organization?   PATRICK PATTERSON: Extremely talented and they have great leadership and they definitely have a great team and city that supports them. I feel like they have Yao, one of the best post players down low, Ariza who can score on the wing, and great point guard in Chuck Hayes who can stop anybody in the post. They are a great-caliber team with potential to win a championship.    Q. How do you feel about Ariza and Jordan Hill?  PATRICK PATTERSON: Somebody who is extremely tough down low and who will work hard on the post and put the ball on the perimeter and shoot the jumpshot and knock it down and extend all the way out to the three and run, and someone who plays tough and puts his heart into the game, so I think I can definitely come in and learn a lot from them and get a lot of experience and just develop my game around them.    Q. Patrick, you were the elder statesman of this special Kentucky group, you were there through good times and bad times; do you have one last parting message for Big Bull Nation?  PATRICK PATTERSON: I'll always be a Big Blue Nation. Big Blue Nation will always be with me and in my heart and wherever I go I will keep it with me, and all I have to say is thank you to them and keep it with me and supporting my family through the years and I definitely will represent the nation with great pride.   Q. Rick Adelman always gets most out of his players; is that a perfect fit to work with him?   PATRICK PATTERSON: Oh, Coach Cal definitely got the most out of me and I look for Coach getting the best out of me again. I truly believe I can get the best out of me and help improve my confidence and jumpshot and running up and down the court and overall game and so many new areas that I haven't even opened up yet.    Q. How much did it help coming from Kentucky when you have other Draft picks and does it look better?   PATRICK PATTERSON: I don't know if it looks better but it shows I can do well around high-caliber teammates and that I can adjust and that I can adapt, and I can definitely lead, as well. I had a bunch of freshman who played like veterans every single night and I had to play alongside them and also had to take a step back and watch them play. I think by playing with them, and alongside them and every single step of the way, it put me in the advantage of other people because I can adapt well and also I can do new things and I can step up and be a leader.  \"}, 'Greg Monroe': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=64428', 'text': 'Q. A lot of young talent in Detroit. Talk about what you bring to the table with your versatility?  GREG MONROE: More talent, versatility, big man that can come in, rebound, score, make plays for his teammates.    Q. Inaudible.   GREG MONROE: You know, you have to make a lot of reads and you have to play the game of basketball a lot. I think that\\'s probably the biggest part of the offense that\\'s helped me prepare for the NBA.   Q. Detroit loves hard work, they rally around guys that work hard. For years they have been known for their defense. Are you going to be a guy that can bring that back?   GREG MONROE: Definitely. I\\'m going to come in and, like I said, just do everything I can, defensively, working hard, high intensity, play hard, so definitely think I can help with that.    Q.

GREG MONROE: Yeah, I won\\'t be outnumbered by that much.    Q. Have you talked to DeJuan Summers?   GREG MONROE: No, I talked to him recently and the last couple of months but he just texted me, told me, \"welcome,\" and I will talk to him more obviously.    Q. Have you spoke with Roy Hibbert about life in the league and also continuing your education at Georgetown?  GREG MONROE: Definitely, Roy was back on campus and I got a chance to work out with him for a few weeks and talked to him a lot. Every time I started at Indiana and went out to eat dinner or something like that, he was helping me a lot.   Q. Georgetown is a fine school, with a very good academic programs; is there a game plan to finish up your studies over there?  GREG MONROE: Definitely, going to try to get as many credits as I can.    Q. Can you just talk about the adjustment from the Georgetown/Princeton system to the pro-style system?  GREG MONROE: It will be a big adjustment and something I was used to for the past two years but transitioning to a pro-style offense, I\\'ll do fine learning, work hard, study a lot and I think transition will be pretty easy.

GREG MONROE: Basically just getting to know me, they were asking me about Princeton and my family and the things they liked about me and of course the concerns defensively and my athleticism like everything but they liked me enough to take me and I wanted to come in and work hard and make the pick worthwhile.    Q. When did you get a sense that this would be the range you would be going in?   GREG MONROE: All along this has been the range. My name has been bumped around and this is right in the middle, so this is the range that I expected.    Q. Inaudible.   GREG MONROE: Coach has been great. He\\'s really supported me ever since I made my decision and he\\'s been there to give me advice. He talked to all of the teams. He\\'s been, you know, converting the stuff that they said back to me and he was in the gym with me just like all of the other coaches working me out and helping me prepare.

My heart is going like a thousand miles per hour, I know that, until I heard my name, I knew it was going to be like that until I heard my name and had a big sigh of relief. All of that hard work and dedication night after night paid off.   Q. I know you didn't get to play any games with Jonny Flynn but you practiced with him for the full year. Talk about how you are looking forward to working with him in Minnesota?  WESLEY JOHNSON: Definitely looking forward to playing with him, the chemistry you have starting out to play with each other, he's eager. Fortunate enough to be able to get drafted and play with him -- I'm excited.   Q. Did he text you?   WESLEY JOHNSON: I was on the phone, and he was yelling out teammates, and he's excited, too.    Q. Minnesota has had you pegged as their guy for the better part of six weeks, what was it about Minnesota and that connection that made them fall in love? Did you know they were that close to be willing to trade up to grab you?   WESLEY JOHNSON: I was hearing that for a while, when I went there they said I would fit right in with what they needed and everything, so I had a great work out and met the staff and everything, but they said my style of play was what they needed, especially the up-tempo pace I play is what they needed.   Q. At what point did you realize you were not going to be a first-round or lottery pick, but a top-five draft pick?  WESLEY JOHNSON: Probably in the middle of the year, I started hearing that and I started really getting confident that I had the ability to be a top-five pick. But really didn't set in until I heard my name.   Q. The Nets could have chosen you; did that cross your mind, the endorsements?   WESLEY JOHNSON: It did and my agent talked a lot about it, but my dream was to be in the NBA and fortunate to be picked my any team and it's a blessing, so thrilled to be going to Minnesota.   Q. Playing in Syracuse, you won't be intimidated by the cold weather?   WESLEY JOHNSON: I'll be fine, going back to Minnesota with the cold weather, I'll be all right.   Q. After the top two picks, anyone could have gone anywhere. How much do you read into projections?   WESLEY JOHNSON: Not at all, I let my agent follow that. I was listening a little bit and until I hear my name, then it's set in stone but it's hard not to listen to stuff like that, but I really just tried not to pay any attention to it and tried to enjoy the ride.    Q. Obviously you had to sit out that six overtime game at Syracuse, but first of all, how frustrating was it for you to do that and then you came back here, your first opportunity against North Carolina and really made a name for yourself.   WESLEY JOHNSON: Especially watching that game, not to be there for the team was hurtful and to see them compete as hard as they did, I loved that -- but when I got an opportunity to play and come back to the Garden, especially after missing last year.    Q. Can you give us an idea of something special that you guys, you and Johnny might be doing in practice together?   WESLEY JOHNSON: Oh, man, that year I sat out, the chemistry is crazy, his ability to pass the ball, so it's going to be a lot, a lot of highlights, the way he plays, so it's going to be a lot of highlights.    Q. Minnesota returns to Syracuse before the season starts to play an exhibition game. How much are you looking forward to playing with Jonny there?   WESLEY JOHNSON: Excited. When I heard that when I was leaving, he told me that we were going to go back -- it's going to be fun. I've always said I wanted to give back to my community and teammates, but to go back to Syracuse with Jonny, it's exciting.   Q. You've talked about what a tough decision it was going to be for you; is there any emotion about going back to Syracuse and thinking about what if you had stayed?   WESLEY JOHNSON: Without a doubt, it was a tough decision for me to make, but I love Syracuse, but it was my dream to go to the NBA, especially now that I'm in the NBA going back. It's going to be fun.    Q. Playing with Jonny, you're going to be playing with Kevin Love, as well. Talk about how that will open up your game, playing with a guy that can grab boards.

Your thoughts?   XAVIER HENRY: First of all, I would like to thank God and my family and friends, without them, I wouldn't be the same person I am today and the same person I went through.  I want to thank the staff for having faith and choosing me to be here today.    Q. Memphis has improved a lot, of course, and they have a lot of talent. Talk about how you are looking to include your perimeter shooting and your athleticism and bring it to the table and help Memphis make the playoffs?   XAVIER HENRY: I'm going to take the same approach as I took to college: Kansas was a great team and I knew if I came in there and worked hard and kept my work ethic and kept my focus, I could compete for a spot at any time.  When I get to Memphis, first day, hard work, and just play hard and just make sure I keep my attitude the same and keep positive influences and just -- I think that's the key to anything, as long as I work hard and I try my hardest and I give it all, things will take care of itself and that's what I'm looking to do when I go to Memphis.    Q. The talent of the Kansas Jayhawks, talk about how that has helped you, to be able to propel your game in the one year?  XAVIER HENRY: I think it helped me a lot and I think it helped me in a different way than you think. It boost me up and put me back into a little role that I had to play with two All-Americans in my team and I think that helped me more stay humble rather than thinking that I had to get 25 every night and I learned from those players, it was good to step back. I think coming to the NBA, there's always going to be other stars around you and I can fill whatever role the coaches needs and I can excel at it and that's what I'm going to try to do.   Q. Cole mentioned he was starting to get nervous around 9 or 10 and I saw you looking at your brother, eyebrows and stuff; what were you feeling around that point?  XAVIER HENRY: Yeah, 9 is where it all opened up. I had great workouts from 9, 10, through about 15 or so, and I knew I had a great chance in going around then, and then they took a couple of guys before. We had question marks on when they took them, so me and my brother, we were just calm but we were just thinking, okay, so where did I do best, next, and where are my next best options to go.   Thankfully Memphis took me at the 12 spot and I'm happy to be here.   Q. That's probably one you couldn't be upset with.   XAVIER HENRY: Yeah, me and Cole, he's one of my best friends in the whole world and I've had fun with him over the summer and I've got to see him a lot. I'm happy for him, it's like a one-two punch from Kansas, 11 and 12.   Q. Are you ready to perform more than what you've done at Kansas?   XAVIER HENRY: I came out, I had great workouts, everybody pinned me as a great three-point shooter and a great role player who is coachable. I'm all those things but that's mostly what I had to do at Kansas.  In the workouts I set out to be the most aggressive player and that's what I did, I was always the most aggressive and most assertive and I made it a point to get to the hole and convert and that's why I knew I would do really well in the Draft because I knew I would slide in guys ahead of me or beside me, because I showed that I could play and compete.    Q. You almost went to school in Memphis, so I'm guessing you're familiar with the city. Are you looking to now playing there professionally?  XAVIER HENRY: Yeah, I'm looking forward to it. I was supposed to be there a year ago playing in college and coaching changes, I went to Kansas but I don't regret going to Kansas. But now going to Memphis, feels like I should be there and I'm going to be happy to be there. I'm going to give it my all as soon as I step in the city.   I'm just grateful I get to go there.    Q. You said you almost went to Memphis; one of the new NBA markets where college is more popular than the NBA. How much do you know about the city?   XAVIER HENRY: I know a lot about the city, just from taking visits when I was going to school. I probably took about six or seven visits. My brother went to school at Memphis before he went to Kansas and I committed and signed for Memphis because I knew I was going to go to school there. I know about the city and I'm going to stay away from the ribs and barbeque because I have to keep my body right. But everything from music to all of the history about Memphis, I know a little bit about it.   Q. Have you been to Graceland?   XAVIER HENRY: No, I haven't been to Graceland.    Q. Who had the better outfit tonight, you or Wes 0Johnson?  XAVIER HENRY: Mine looked better; Wes is way more creative. Threw me off. I didn't know if he had pajama pants or are they sleeping pants or sweat pants or something. He pulled it off. He had a top to match it. He looked good tonight. Whoever did his shoot, he should tell them thank you.   Q. In your opinion, what other suits did you like tonight?  XAVIER HENRY: I liked John Wall's suit, a nice shade of blue; Cole's suit -- we got them done by the same people so they are similar. I think everybody came out happy for a great occasion.    Q. Now this is a revelation: Is there actually an NBA tailor that we have been unaware of? I thought it was like fashion week and designers competing for your attention. Is there one place where you go?   XAVIER HENRY: Not one place. There's a place we go that have history of making Draft suits and we like the material they use so we use them and stuff.  \"}, 'Gordon Hayward': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=64427', 'text': \"Q. What are you feeling now?   GORDON HAYWARD: Right now I'm just so thankful to be drafted by the Utah Jazz. It's been a blessing from God for me. The past couple of years have been a whirlwind. It's been a surreal, winning the state championship as a senior and that just seems like it was the other day and it was about three years ago.   Last year, the Final Four; and for me, I'm just really thankful right now. I've got to thank the Miller family and the whole Jazz organization for drafting me and seeing something in me, so I really appreciate that, so I'm excited to get going.    Q. You're going to be playing under Jerry Sloan, and definitely, he's into tough-nosed players and you resemble that. How will that be a match made in heaven for you and him?  GORDON HAYWARD: You talk about tough-nosed players, and I believe when you go out on the court, you have to put it all out there and play as hard as you can. For me, that's what I'm going to try to do and thankful that I get to play for a coach like Jerry Sloan, he's been in the league so long and he's done things the right way and he gets the job done. Like I said earlier, I'm blessed and thankful.    Q. How upset do you think your family is right now at the Pacers management and do you think they will rent your room to Paul George?   GORDON HAYWARD: They are really happy right now. I understand what you're saying that it was one pick removed. They have been supportive through this whole time and have been thankful, as well, and they are really excited, too.    Q. I don't know if you had seen Johnson since the NCAA Tournament, but did you see any words and reminisce about your victory?   GORDON HAYWARD: To be honest, we talked about it a little bit backstage before we had this Draft. He said he respects Butler, a couple of guys were hating on Butler still, but we had some laughs and he's going to have a great career. We talked about it and now both of us are going to move forward and hopefully have good careers.   Q. Does any part of you think, wait a second, I beat him, may have out-played him in that game; how come he's going before you?   GORDON HAYWARD: I think that obviously he's laid down some groundwork on his game that he's a great player, so he fits in well for Minnesota and I know he'll do just fine. For me, I'm not worried about that at all. I'm so excited to be going to Utah.    Q. Did you watch NBA Finals, especially close this year, knowing that the possibility was that could be you next year? There was a lot of hype with the NCAA Tournament and how well you did, and that's the mecca of college, The Finals are the mecca of the NBA; did you watch closely knowing you would be playing them next year?  GORDON HAYWARD: I think this year watching it was a little different than every other year I've watched it because of what you're saying. Next year I'm going to be right there on the court competing against those guys. When I was watching it, there was a part of it that I was still just a fan but then I sit back and say, that could be me next year. I think it's exciting, very exciting.   Q. I realize this is a very exciting moment for you, but in Indianapolis, but at the water coolers tomorrow in the office, there's going to be the perfect story of high school and college and maybe pro; what do you think about that? Obviously it's not in your control, kind of what happened?   GORDON HAYWARD: Well, I think it's like I said earlier, I'm just so thankful to be going to Utah, for me, just putting on an NBA uniform in any city will bring a smile to my face.   Like I said, I'm just really excited about Utah. This would have been cool to play in Indianapolis but it would have been really cool to play for the Jazz.    Q. Do you allow yourself to imagine that as the trifecta of your experience?   GORDON HAYWARD: When I was little, that's who I dreamed I would play for, probably because I lived there, and that's something that I think every little boy in Indiana did, they pretended they were Reggie Miller in their backyard.  For me to be able to play in the NBA, Utah Jazz, winning program, Jerry Sloan, it's very exciting.   Q. How do you think you'll fit in offensively? Obviously the Jazz run a lot of pick-and-rolls, really push the ball and proficient in the half-court set; how do you see yourself in the offensive game?   GORDON HAYWARD: I think it's hard to tell at first until you get to Utah and start to play with the guys and practice, and I think can't really tell where you're going to fit in. For me I'm going to go out there and play hard and take it from there.  I know that you have to go out there and step up your game on every single level to get on the court with these guys. It's a challenge to get on the court and these guys in Utah already have a good team. Like I said, I'm excited to go out there and just start playing.   Q. How tough was your decision, because if you came back, Butler would easily have been in the Final Four again. How tough was it to weigh your decision?   GORDON HAYWARD: Toughest decision I've ever had to make, and a lot of that was just because of the people at Butler; the fact that we had everyone coming back, you take that into account, in the NCAA Tournament, anything can happen, so you never know. The tough part is just the people at Butler. If you've ever been around there, they are phenomenal people and they do things the right way and it's just a great program, a great program.  Also, the fact that I was at home; I was 15, 20 minutes from my home and some of my family and friends were there. That was really the tough part. From a basketball standpoint, I was ready to go.   Q. What you guys did last year was super special, it was one of the most unique things we have seen in a while. How do you put all of that in perspective as you answer a new level of your life?   GORDON HAYWARD: I think that for me, it's something that I'll look back and reflect on later in life. I know that at the next level, there's guys who have done similar things on every single team. It's a new level and you're kind of put back at the bottom of the totem pole, so you've just got to work hard and follow what the older veteran players do, and try to learn and soak in everything you can.   And then like I said, maybe later back in life, I'll get a chance to look back and kind of live that up with my teammates.   Q. Have you ever heard of Steve Alford, had a chance to be picked by the Pacers; have you ever met him or will you seek him out?   GORDON HAYWARD: I think he was in San Jose when we were there for the NCAA Tournament, so I got a chance to meet him. In fact, when I was little, he had a thing called Steve Alford Workouts and that's what I did in my backyard, ball handling skills, and I was very aware of him and anyone in India that was very aware of him.   Q. How is it going to a small market?  GORDON HAYWARD: It's similar to Indianapolis and not that big and I think I'll feel a lot more comfortable. When I walked around there and went through the workout it seemed like a really nice city. I'm excited to go there and start a future there.  \"}, 'Paul George': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=64432', 'text': \"Q. Talk about playing with Granger, similar type of game and how much you look forward to learning from him and coming from a major school?  PAUL GEORGE: I'm extremely happy. I look at Danny as a bigger brother and mentor to myself. We have been working out and training together out in Los Angeles, so we kind of have a bond, you know, as it is already, so I'm extremely happy to be in this situation and to be with this team and organization, I mean, I just can't wait to start.    Q. Indiana, did you see it coming? Did they give you those signs?   PAUL GEORGE: I didn't know what to expect, I told my agent to let it ride out. I didn't want no hints on where I was going so it was a surprise to me go there. I knew they liked me and I had a good time there when I did have my workout there, so it wasn't that big of a surprise.    Q. Inaudible.   PAUL GEORGE: I became better at understanding the game and I still have a long ways to go and I just felt like to get better and improve my skills, I felt like I had to come out this year and just learn. I feel like my learning curve is so high that I'm ready to just take on anything.    Q. Inaudible.   PAUL GEORGE: It would be great to share some words with him. That's a legend. I don't want to start out by saying I want to take his footsteps but I want to share some words with him and go through this process with him on my side.   Q. Miller was able to become a national figure; have you talked about endorsement deals with your agent?   PAUL GEORGE: Yeah, all that stuff is not pertaining to me. I just want to get to playing basketball and let everything take care of itself.    Q. The Pacers with Jim O'Brien play an open system, a lot of three-pointers, but they have lacked consistency the last couple of years not making the playoffs; how can you help that?  PAUL GEORGE: I think I can help with consistency. Being 6-9, I can do pretty much a lot of things on the court and I want to take this summer leading up to the NBA season to really work on my game to make sure I'm ready. I definitely don't want to come into a situation where a team that's on the verge of winning -- and be a slacker.   So like I say, I just want to take this opportunity just to get better and work on my game.    Q. Do you feel any pressure to be better, because a lot of people in Indiana were saying to pick Gordon Hayward.   PAUL GEORGE: Yeah, Gordon Hayward is a good friend of mine --   Q. But he was gone.   PAUL GEORGE: Luckily. Yeah, I mean, I definitely want to, you know, do good for the fans and I want to pan out to what they want me to be and I think that I will achieve that.  \"}, 'Tiny Gallon': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=64439', 'text': \"Q. Talk about your feelings.   TINY GALLON: You know, I was sitting out there, a little bit nervous. People were saying I could go in the first round and saying a lot of stuff like that, but I mean, when I seen it was getting close to the end of first round, I was like, okay, I might be in the second round.   And once I seen the second round kept going, and I just said, okay, I'm going to get picked up by one of these teams. And I said, okay, whatever happens, happens. All it is is in God's hands, so I was ready for it.    Q. Do you feel like you really should have been a first round pick in your heart?   TINY GALLON: Yeah, I think I should have been a first-rounder, but I can't complain about it, as long as I'm on the team.  I'm on the team, I have a great point guard, a great friend, Brandon that's going to push me. I've got a great coach now, Scott Skiles. As long as I'm in the right position to play, I think it's okay, it's fine with me. I have something to prove every day.   Q. What will the fans expect from you? What will you bring to the team?   TINY GALLON: I'm going to bring a lot. Everybody, even the Knicks fans was saying, he's a steal. I'm going to bring a lot to this team, I promise you. I'm going to bring a lot to Milwaukee.    Q. Are you really ready for Scott Skiles?   TINY GALLON: No, I'm ready. When I went to their workout, I seen how serious he was. But I know for the hour and a half, two hours, it's all business. This is not a kid's game. This is business and I'm willing to put in the work for that with Coach and plus, you know, I know Coach Sampson from Oklahoma and all that stuff and I'm going to deal with him and I'm going to put in the extra work. I'm going to put in the extra work.   Q. What can you tell people who are out there who will go through some of the things that happened with you?  TINY GALLON: I think for me it was a great experience, seeing some of my great friends -- DeMarcus since eighth grade; if you are close with people in the Draft, I came out here to support them, too. When their name was called I stood up and clapped for them.  Just come up there with a positive attitude and come up here and stay positive. As long as you're blessed on a team to play professional basketball, I think that's great. I think there's a lot of kids that would love to be in my shoes right now, that would love to be in my shoes to play basketball. I just come with a positive attitude.   I had my mother out there, she was kind of down but she was happy that my name was called and I told her, I promise that I'm going to do a lot of stuff for Milwaukee.   Q. Do you feel like you got a second chance of sorts because you feel as though you dropped but you think you should have been that top-tier talent? You alluded to being a steal; does that empower you to be a better player than you are?   TINY GALLON: It's like a fuel to the fire. I'm going to be upset playing, that's what you've got to be, but I'm going to be even more upset when I go out there because I know I should have been in this situation, or I think I should have been first round and I think I should have been somewhere I was supposed to have been, but I love Milwaukee and I love the Bucks, so like I said, them putting me right there in the right situation, I'm just going have to work a little more harder, which I'm willing to do.  \"}, 'Derrick Favors': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=64423', 'text': \"Q. Feelings right now?   DERRICK FAVORS: Feeling very excited, a lot of things going through my head and ready to get started.   Q. New Jersey has a lot of talent and new leadership, how are you looking forward to playing and the possibilities?   DERRICK FAVORS: They have got a good, young team. They are good and I think I can fit in well and I think I can learn a lot from Lopez and playing alongside of him will be easy for me and I can sit back and learn and do what I do best which is play defense and rebound.    Q. Inaudible.   DERRICK FAVORS: Just work hard and try to help them improve. I know the owners and coaches want to go in a new direction so I just want to come in and work hard and help them improve.   Q. Are you willing to guarantee playoffs your first year on the team?   DERRICK FAVORS: I don't know (laughing). Going to wait and see, I'm not going to say things, so just got to wait and see.    Q. Did you have any idea before David Stern called your name that you were going to be the Nets pick?   DERRICK FAVORS: I didn't know I was going to the Nets. I pretty much knew John was going to go 1 and Evan was going 2, but I had no idea I was going to the Nets, and when they called me, I was just excited.   Q. What do you know about Avery Johnson and what's it going to be like playing for him?   DERRICK FAVORS: He's a great coach. He's coached with the Mavericks and led them to an NBA Finals, so I think it will be a great opportunity for me to grow as a player, to play in front of him.    Q. Defensively, Avery Johnson has heavy emphasis on defense; how do you think you'll be able to fit in that system?   DERRICK FAVORS: You know, one of the strongest parts of my game is playing defense, so I think he can help me become a better defender with the way that he coaches and he can really push me and make me the player that they think I'm going to be.    Q. How did your one-on-one work outs with Cousins go and who got the best of who in those?   DERRICK FAVORS: It went well, DeMarcus is a good player and we are both competitive players and it went well. You really couldn't tell who won the matchup because we were just going back and forth on each other so pretty much a tie.    Q. Brook Lopez has been using the high and low post and whichever one he is not occupying is the one you will play; do you prefer?  DERRICK FAVORS: I can play the high post, I can play the low post, so I prefer both.   Q. Have you met your new owner yet? And do you know about him?   DERRICK FAVORS: No, I haven't met him yet, but I've heard he's a guy that's ready to turn around the program and lead them to a championship within a few years.   So I'm just happy to be a part of it.    Q. How do you characterize yourself as far as your weaknesses and your strengths and what do you know about the Nets?   DERRICK FAVORS: When I seen them last year, they wasn't a bad team. They was just a young team. They just had a young inexperienced team and now being they are hungry to improve from last year and try to make the playoffs this year.   Q. We talked in Chicago and you were very overwhelmed by the process and now that the Draft is over, there's finality. What do you expect in the next three or four months?   DERRICK FAVORS: Just be a lot of hard work. I know they are going to bring me in for training camp and Summer League and it's just going to be playing basketball now, since the Draft is over, there's no more media stuff, no more work outs, no more tryouts, just all basketball stuff.  \"}, 'Ed Davis': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=64424', 'text': 'Q.

ED DAVIS: Right, right, I really learned a lot during the whole Carolina thing, my two years there, you know what I\\'m saying. We did great one year and then not so good my sophomore year, but like I said, I learned a lot but I\\'m really looking forward to being in Toronto, a young team, they really played up-and-down and I\\'m happy to be there.    Q. Chris Bosh, not controversy, but there\\'s talk about him not being back in Toronto. Are you looking back to stepping up to the plate possibly in the four position?   ED DAVIS: I\\'m just going to work hard and that\\'s what my agent told me with this pick, you have a chance to play right away and possibly start, so I\\'m just going to play hard and I\\'m happy to be here with DeMar, he just texted me a couple of times, so I think it\\'s going to be a good fit.    Q. I know you have an agent; have you chosen a CPA? Now playing in a foreign country, the tax structure becomes real cumbersome.   ED DAVIS: I already have a financial guy, so just more, I guess, letting him know and telling him, you have more work for yourself but I\\'m not worried about that and now I have to get a passport.   Q. Are you going to save all your receipts as well?   ED DAVIS: Oh, yeah, I would, when that time\\'s come, I\\'m ready for it.    Q. You said you needed a passport; you\\'ve never been to Toronto before?   ED DAVIS: No, I didn\\'t work out for them.

When you\\'re going to a team that you have not worked out for, how familiar are you with the coaching staff? Did you get to speak with them, as well in the Chicago?   ED DAVIS: I spoke with the GM and all of the guys that were there, I think maybe one assistant coach there, and all of the player personnel people. But I mean, it\\'s a good organization, and if I have any questions, I\\'m going to talk to DeMar tonight and he\\'ll just give me the scoop on it.   Q. Outside of DeMar, how much do you know about the team?   ED DAVIS: I know they have big free agents coming up with Chris Bosh and people are saying he\\'s not going to be there but right now I\\'m just going to try to work hard and earn the starting job.    Q. You mentioned that you talked to Brian Colangelo, talk about your impression of him, because he\\'s a good basketball mind.   ED DAVIS: I talked to him like 30 minutes ago when we were sitting down in the Green Room and he just told me that \"if you come here, we\\'ll be glad to have you,\" and he\\'s a good guy and looking forward to meeting him again.

You're a very physical player, so talk about how you have to really build your strength to be able to be physical every night, of course, an 82-game season in the NBA?  DeMARCUS COUSINS: Just going into the NBA, period, you have to work hard and you have to prove every aspect of your game. But I am a physical player and strength is something I do rely on.    Q. Since Chicago, for whatever reason, you've been a guy that's been the hunted and now you're going to be playing with your good friend, Tyreke; what will you do in Sacramento?  DeMARCUS COUSINS: Hopefully build some good chemistry and bring a championship back to the building for the Kings.   Q. Can you talk about your Draft workouts and how it affected you, good or bad?   DeMARCUS COUSINS: A lot of my workouts were conditioning and skill and I believe it actually helped me out, I believe it helped me out a lot.    Q. I see you have the purple shirt on tonight.

Some have said you could be the No. 2 pick in the Draft, so the first time you play against Philly and New Jersey, will you take that on to the court and try to prove that they should have taken you?

Ramon Sessions is on Minnesota, so did you speak with him at all, even while you were at Nevada, get some advice on the next level and how much you look forward to playing with him?   LUKE BABBITT: Yeah, we didn't -- I didn't think there was a great chance that we would play together. You know, there's always a chance. We talked a little bit. You know, he's just an unbelievable person. Obviously a great basketball player from Nevada, but you know, I'm thrilled to be his teammate, because we never were teammates in Nevada, even though we never went there.   Q. The program over the last five years has really excelled, and you were a part of that; talk about how now, you are looking to put that experience of helping the program grow into going into a situation with the Minnesota Timberwolves?   LUKE BABBITT: I think at Nevada, we are a smaller school, and you know, had to overcome being in a mid-major. That was a challenge.   You know, Minnesota is working their way up. There are a lot of young pieces, a lot of young talent, a GM who is very active and will make moves. So I think, you know, the sky is the limit for the Minnesota Timberwolves.    Q. Who are some of the guys you are looking most forward to going up against in the NBA?  LUKE BABBITT: No one in particular. You know, I'm just looking forward to being a pro and being in the NBA. That's always been my dream. Obviously LeBron James, Pierce, Durant, those are some of my favorites players, but when I step on the court, I probably won't recognize them and it will be just another basketball game.   Q. Have you spoken to Wes Johnson since getting picked?   LUKE BABBITT: No, I haven't. We talked a little bit obviously before the Draft, but I don't think coming into it in the Green Room, anybody anticipated things and nobody could foresee anything like this happening.   Q. Any idea how they will use you and him?  LUKE BABBITT: I don't know. I wasn't really expecting it, but I'm very happy.    Q. Are you looking forward to playing in a triangle offense and how familiar are you with it?   LUKE BABBITT: Actually my freshman year, we ran a triangle offense with Coach Fox who learned the offense from Tex Winter who was with the Lakers and Kurt Rambis is obviously bringing it to Minnesota.   As well as any college player could, I probably have a pretty good understanding of the triangle, but obviously, a lot to learn.   Q. Reno gets a little chilly in the winter, but do you have a nice, big winter coat ready for Minneapolis?   LUKE BABBITT: No, I don't.

Talk about young talent with the Clippers organization, and also veterans, as well, how you are looking forward to learning and growing with the team?   AL-FAROUQ AMINU: I just can't wait for it. I watched Baron Davis growing up, so many things I can learn, Kaman, as well, a great post player.  And playing with Griffin, a great talent, it will only make my job easier.    Q. The cap room and free agency, will you be following that to see how the roster will be growing more?   AL-FAROUQ AMINU: I just got on the team, so I just started following them I guess. I mean, I'm going to look for into it in the future I guess.    Q. How do you feel about going to a franchise like the Clippers, knowing their history and kind of the long run of struggles that the team has gone through?  AL-FAROUQ AMINU: I guess every team has a history either good or bad. When you're drafted, you just try your best to change it for the good. That's what I'm trying to do.    Q. I'm going to follow up with a question. Having played at Wake Forest in the same state as UNC and Duke, is that great as far as being an underdog in the same market?   AL-FAROUQ AMINU: Yeah, I guess it is good, like we were doing at Wake, just trying to contend with those schools.   Q. You are going to a team without a coach; what will it be like when you first get to the team, just rely on your teammates or meet the front office guys?   AL-FAROUQ AMINU: Both. My teammates, I mean, you're closer to your teammates than anybody so I'll try to get a good feel from all of them, and the people in the front office, as well. I can meet whoever is there, so it really doesn't make that much of a difference to me.    Q.

Talk about how playing with the high-quality players helped you propel your game and how it will help you at the next level?   COLE ALDRICH: It\\'s really going to help me a lot, because I think my freshman year, I played with five pros. Last year, with Sherron and I on the team, and us three on the Draft right now, it\\'s one of those things that really sets you up to really prepare you for success.    Q. I know you\\'re looking forward to running the pick-and-roll and everything.   COLE ALDRICH: I\\'m very excited because Chris Paul is one of the best guys -- one of the best point guards in the league and a very unselfish guy at that, so it\\'s going to be fun playing with those guys.   Q. What strengths do you think that you bring to a team? What\\'s going to be the biggest asset?   COLE ALDRICH: Oh, definitely defensive side. You know, the biggest thing to my game is shot-blocking, defending and rebounding. You know, I\\'m kind of a unique big guy who loves to go and bang other big guys and kind of do the dirty work. You know, I could really do that well and I\\'m just going to continue to work out there.   Q. There\\'s indications there\\'s a trade that may move you to Oklahoma City; if you do end up there, do you feel like that\\'s a unique place for you, because they obviously have such a need at center?   COLE ALDRICH: Oh, yeah. I think whatever team it is; if I stay in New Orleans, or if I go to Oklahoma City, you know, the need for a big guy is great. I\\'m not going to try to go in and do spectacular things, only the things that I\\'m good at. I\\'m good at rebounding and defending and blocking shots and that\\'s how I\\'m going to make my presence on the court early is doing those things. I\\'m definitely working hard on my offensive game, too.    Q. You have a very good post player in David West, as well, with New Orleans. So how is that going to free things for you? How will it free things up for you, especially on the boards?   COLE ALDRICH: Oh, I think it\\'s going to be good, just going up and battling with another big guy. The thing I\\'m excited about is learning from those guys and picking their brains. They have been in the league for years and I just aspire to do what they have done so far. I think just picking their brains and going out there and learning so much.   Q. What do you know about Monty Williams, first-year coach?  COLE ALDRICH: He\\'s only been there since I think the 7th, so, you know, he was at workouts. He ran our workouts. He\\'s going to be a great coach. He\\'s one of those coaches that really loves to kind of get back on the court and just be there with the guys, you know, just make sure that the guys work hard and it\\'s going to be another great coach to play for.    Q. Can you just talk about two things, Xavier going after you, and the moment that you had with your dad and family, knowing how important they have been to you?   COLE ALDRICH: It\\'s great, because I was texting Xavier over the past week, just seeing if he had got his invite out here and all that. He text me late one night and said, \"I got it. I\\'m going to see you out there.\" I could imagine how big his smile was out there.  Just great to see him, and you know, I\\'m just so thankful for my parents. My parents and my family, just to be there for me; I\\'ve gone through so much, and you know, without them, I don\\'t think we could be as strong as we are.    Q. Was it icing on the cake, I guess, two Jayhawks going right in a row like that? Can you describe what that is like for you guys?   COLE ALDRICH: It\\'s great. Xavier and I have become great friends. We always text each other and hang out. We always love just being around each other because we have got a great friendship and he really looks up to me and I look up to him, too. It\\'s really a special deal.    Q. You lost your front tooth in a game; have you embraced that kind of bad boy image?   COLE ALDRICH: I did? (Removing cap, revealing gap between front teeth). (Laughter).  I\\'m a goofy guy that loves to play hard. I lost it my sophomore year, and I had a mouth guard in and fortunately I only lost one. It\\'s a characteristic of me, a guy that loves to go and get in the trenches and just fight for my team, whether it\\'s breaking my nose like I did my sophomore year or losing my tooth like I did my sophomore year. I just love getting in there and fighting with the guys.   Q. Oklahoma City obviously has another former Jayhawk in this Nick Collison; have you established a relationship with him over your two years at Kansas?   COLE ALDRICH: Oh, yeah, he comes back every once in awhile and we go down and play Oklahoma City or Oklahoma -- Oklahoma State, he tries to get out to those games. So just with him on Oklahoma City or with Julian still on the Hornets, it\\'s going to be a fun next few years.    Q. Would you like to be able to pick your employer in the NBA like in college?  COLE ALDRICH: Oh, I would have no idea what to do. The whole draft process, I\\'ve been pretty relaxed the whole time until, you know, it got around that 9, kind of 10 area, and there, and you know, I was a little bit nervous. I was trying to keep my mind -- I was texting my friends jokes and stuff like that. I was trying to keep my mind off of things. It\\'s an exciting time for us.    Q. I have to ask, does the University of Kansas have a good dental and other medical facilities that you recommend?   COLE ALDRICH: Oh, yeah, we definitely do. Justin Anderson does a great job, just haven\\'t had enough time to get it done. Been too busy.  '}}, 2011: {'Derrick Williams': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=72224', 'text': 'Q. Your thoughts on going No. 2?  DERRICK WILLIAMS: I\\'m happy. Ever since high school when I started to actually take basketball serious, I\\'m just glad that my dreams came true, and I\\'m happy that this whole franchise chose me number two, and I\\'m just going to keep working and try to be the best player I can possibly be and make the rest of my teammates better. I know a few of them are happy, as well. Hopefully we can win a lot more games than we won last season.   Q. How much are you looking forward to being able to freelance when you have big men like Kevin Love who specializes in grabbing boards? How much are you looking forward to having your game flourish on the front line?  DERRICK WILLIAMS: I\\'m happy, especially when people play that hard and you have people on your team that like to play hard, it\\'s always good. Some players have all of the talent but don\\'t play hard, and Kevin Love, he\\'s going to get all the rebounds, 30 and 30 last season. They show a lot of effort and that\\'s what I like about the whole team.    Q. They have a lot of players at the three and the four. What are your thoughts on playing time there? They have got Anthony Randolph and Michael Beasley, a lot of players that play your spots.   DERRICK WILLIAMS: I work my butt off to get in that starting rotation. They told me to do that to make me better, and I think that with everybody being so young on the team, I think you can push each other. Everybody has young, fresh legs. I\\'m just going to look forward to them pushing me, and me pushing them, as well.    Q. When you first knew that you were probably going to come out for the Draft, how much closer did you watch the NBA this season and see the competition that you were going to go up against the next season?   DERRICK WILLIAMS: I focused on it a lot, just seeing how hard they play, from the regular season to the playoffs. I think the last series, The Finals, really summed it up for me. I\\'m going to have to step it up a lot in order to produce in this league on the offensive side and the defensive side.   You know, it was a long season. You have to take care of your body, I know that. All in all, it\\'s just about who is ready and who is focused. I\\'m going to come into training camp ready and focused just like everybody else wants to.    Q. How much more appealing does Ricky Rubio make Minnesota?  DERRICK WILLIAMS: He makes them a lot better. Even though he has not played any games over here yet, when you have a pass-first point guard on your team, he wants to make you better. Whenever you have a guy like that, it just brings joy to me; a guy that can get to the lane and kick out who wants to pass you the ball. He doesn\\'t really care about points.   And that\\'s what I like about him. I know we are going to have a big season this year, and hopefully win a lot more games than last season.    Q. Are you concerned at all about not knowing who the coach is? Are you concerned that you want to know what system you\\'re going into? Are you pretty much thinking about that?  DERRICK WILLIAMS: No, I\\'m not really focused on that right now, who the coach is or who it isn\\'t going to be. I\\'m not really focused on that right now. I\\'m just going to get my body into the best of shape as possible. If he\\'s the coach, that\\'s great. I\\'m just trying to get my body ready for the season and that\\'s really all I\\'m focusing on right now.    Q. Talk about the workout with Minnesota, what was it like going in, what did you hear from them? There was a lot of uncertainty whether or not they were going to keep the pick. Was there a connection when you went there?  DERRICK WILLIAMS: Yeah, immediately, I felt like I was really comfortable. A lot of people don\\'t think this is really me, always smiling and having a good time. And I really fit in with them really well, on and off the court. One of my coaches was like, \"he\\'s a monster,\" and I really took that as a compliment. I\\'m always really eager to learn and I think that\\'s why they picked me, because I\\'m ready to learn. I want to learn, and I want to get better and I want to make this team better.    Q. After all of the talk about the No. 2 pick maybe being moved, were you surprised the Timberwolves did ultimately pick with you and do you think they will stick with you?  DERRICK WILLIAMS: I hope they will stick with me. At the end of the day, I did all I can do. If they are going to trade the pick, they are going to trade the pick. I can\\'t do anything about it.   I want to be there. I want to make that team better, that whole franchise. I want to get them from a losing record to a winning record. That\\'s my job, and that\\'s why they chose me. So we\\'ll see what they do with it. But I want to stay.  '}, 'Kemba Walker': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=72230', 'text': \"Q. Your thoughts on being drafted by Charlotte?   KEMBA WALKER: I'm extremely happy to be going to Charlotte. I'm happy to be a New York City kid, being able to live his dream. A lot of guys from New York grow up dreaming about playing in the NBA, and here I am going to Charlotte playing for what people say is the greatest player to play this game, and I'm going to play for his team.  I'm happy that he's giving me this opportunity, this whole week, this whole weekend, I've been hearing a lot of things about myself, but he's giving me a chance and I really appreciate it.    Q. You were not exactly sure how things were going to play out. Did this exceed your expectations?  KEMBA WALKER: I'm happy. I'm happy. I can't complain at all. If I went 30, I wouldn't be mad, honestly.   I'm just happy to be in the NBA. You know, I'm just going to continue to work hard and you know just keep on improving.   Q. What do you know about the Bobcats already, and what are your thoughts on maybe sharing time with D.J. Augustin who is another young, fast point guard like yourself?   KEMBA WALKER: Well, I know a couple of guys on the team -- I know of a couple of guys on the team, but as far as sharing time with D.J., I have no problem. As long as we are playing well and we are winning, if I can do anything, anything possible to help that team, I'm willing.    Q. Being as intense of a player as you are, how much will you be picking Michael Jordan's mind while you're there?  KEMBA WALKER: All the time. He's the greatest player to ever play the game so, anything I can learn from that man, I'm going to ask a lot of questions. I'm going to go in there with an open mind and just be ready to learn.    Q. Right before you got drafted, you were described as a guy that Michael Jordan would love. Can you tell us why?  KEMBA WALKER: I'm a winner. He was a winner. He had a lot of heart when he played, and I'm all about heart. I go out there, I compete every night, and you know, I'm not going to go down without a fight.    Q. Talk about how when you get to Charlotte, how the skill set things that you have to work on to really get those minutes and be able to pass D.J. in playing time?  KEMBA WALKER: Well, I'm going to have to work on a lot of things. First of all, I'm going to have to adjust to the NBA, first of all. It's a different ballgame. There's still a lot of room for improvement in my shooting and my decisionmaking.    Q. From that little tiny gym up until now, can you talk about the culmination of the hard work and your journey?  KEMBA WALKER: My hard work -- I've always had talents but hard work just took my talent to another level. I guess I deserve this; I deserve it, and I'm extremely happy to have this opportunity.    Q. Talk about what the Charlotte Bobcats have said to you, what are their expectations of you and what have you heard from the team?  KEMBA WALKER: Nothing. I have no idea right now. When I met with those guys, they really just asked me no questions about my upbringing. They told me they think I would fit in well with their team, that's it.   Q. Has everything gone by so quickly for you, with the national tournament, being here and being drafted, have you had time to reflect on that and did your focus change to this? Or now will you have a breather to think about everything that's happened over the last couple of months?  KEMBA WALKER: Yeah, it's been like a movie. This whole year has been magical, honestly. So many different, crazy things have been happening to me, and you know, I just feel lucky. I feel blessed. I have God on my side and hopefully the sky is the limit for me.    Q. Talk about the 2008 point guard class, it's looking pretty solid, Brandon Jennings, yourself, Jrue Holiday and Tyreke Evans. Talk about how impressive you guys have been able to grow?   KEMBA WALKER: Definitely. We take things to heart when people say we are a weak class. We just go out there and try to prove guys wrong, and we have. My high school class, it's pretty strong I think, a lot of those guys are in the NBA now and doing pretty well, and here I come.    Q. What do you think you learned at UCONN from Coach Calhoun that will serve you in the NBA?  KEMBA WALKER: Pace, I learned pace. I learned how to use my speed. I learned when to slow it down and I think that would definitely translate to the NBA game.    Q. Have you had a chance to talk to Coach Calhoun?  KEMBA WALKER: No, I haven't. I haven't had a chance to speak to him but I'm pretty sure he's probably calling me right now, honestly. But no, not yet.    Q. With all of the skills you're bringing to the NBA, what do you think your biggest adjustment will be?  KEMBA WALKER: Biggest adjustment? I really have no idea. Like I said, I'm going in with an open mind and I'm just going to be willing to learn.    Q. Obviously D.J. Augustine is already there, he had a very good season last year. Both of you guys can really score the basketball as well as facilitate. Are you comfortable playing off the ball, or do you feel most comfortable with the ball in your hands and leading the team as the guard?   KEMBA WALKER: I'm definitely more confident playing on the ball, but last year, having to score so much, I learned how to be off the ball. If there's a situation where me and D.J. is in the game together, both of us, depending how the night is going can play off the ball, so there's no problem with it.  \"}, 'Nikola Vucevic': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=72237', 'text': \"Q. Nikola, your thoughts on being drafted by the 76ers?   NIKOLA VUCEVIC: First, I wanted to say that this was by far the greatest moment of my life. When I heard my name called, I was just going to hold myself, I had to cry a little bit and hug my parents and my agent. It was a great feeling. I'm looking forward to the next step now. It's just starting now and I'm going to work as hard as I ever did now to play at the next level.    Q. Philadelphia, they are on the cusp with a lot of good, young players, and they lack at the five position, and you bring that type of consistent play. How much are you looking forward to getting an opportunity to possibly start on opening night?  NIKOLA VUCEVIC: Well, to possibly start, that's something I didn't really -- that's something that's kind of far now. I'm just looking forward to get in the process and start practicing with the team and working out and get to know my teammates, and then whatever happens, happens. I'm not thinking about starting or anything. I just want to get my team and work as hard as I can and get some playing time.    Q. When you worked out for Doug Collins, what was the one aspect of your game he said you needed to work on?  NIKOLA VUCEVIC: He didn't really tell me anything. I met with him once in Philly and once in Chicago at the Combine. I felt like those were the two best meetings I had. Coach Collins, he told me he wished he could bring me in and he really only told me good things about me. I guess now that I'm with them, he's probably going to tell me what to work on.    Q. Philadelphia has a great young team and tons of potential, how excited are you to join that young core?  NIKOLA VUCEVIC: Like I said, it's one of my favorite teams I wanted to get picked by. I played against Jrue Holiday when he was at UCLA, so I know him a little bit and I got to meet a couple of players when I went there to work out. I think they are a great fit for me and I think I will be able to fit in there really well and I'm really looking forward to it.    Q. You're going to play the center position in the NBA, that's a tough job. Do you feel like you're up to that? What's your game going to translate in this level?  NIKOLA VUCEVIC: That was one of the things I thought about in making my decision to enter the NBA Draft. There's a lot of things that I can still work and become stronger, but one of the main things that people questioned was my toughness but I think I learned how to play tough and aggressive in college and coming to college in America, I think that helped me a lot. I think I will be able to play the position in the NBA.   Q. What emotions went through your mind when you walked on the stage and got to shake David Stern's hand?  NIKOLA VUCEVIC: It's just a dream come true and something that I dreamed of since I was little. My dad, he was my coach for years, and he told me I could just make it if I worked hard and always believe that I can and I just work hard, and the hard work paid off. When I heard my name called today, it was a great feeling.   Q. Can you talk about the Draft experience for you? You were not actually like in the room, so what was that like to see those players and their parent there?  NIKOLA VUCEVIC: I knew a couple of days before that I was not going to be in the Green Room, so I wasn't expecting that. I knew coming into this process I was not one of the top prospects. I knew I was going to go to be in the first round and I just wanted to be able to shake David Stern's hand and get my hat.   Q. Do you know before today that the 76ers would take you?  NIKOLA VUCEVIC: I kind of knew but not 100% for sure. I kind of knew, so I kind of had an idea where I could go.  \"}, 'Jan Vesely': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=72233', 'text': \"Q. Jan, can you talk about when you found out that you were going to the wizards, and just your immediate reaction to playing with John Wall?  JAN VESELY: When I found out? I think like five minutes -- three to five minutes before I go on the stage.    Q. And playing with John Wall?   JAN VESELY: Of course, he's a very, very good point guard. He can open up a fast break really, really quick. So I think I like his game, it's a fast team, and I'm happy to be there.    Q. Talk about your game. What is your game going to be at the NBA level and what do you feel like you're going to bring to the Wizards?  JAN VESELY: I think my game, it's a really fast game. I like a lot of fast breaks, and I think I can work on that.    Q. How much did the Wizards scout you throughout the last couple of months? I know they saw you work out. What was their communication with you through this process?  JAN VESELY: I communicated with them after that. I had great feelings after that meeting.    Q. Talk about how you came across your love of the game for basketball; in the Czech Republic, it's not a popular sport, and I know you said you want to make basketball more popular in your home country?  JAN VESELY: Basketball in my country is not so popular, but after this night, I think -- I hope, that the basketball will be more popular. I will do my best to help that.    Q. What part of your game do you feel is most polished and will translate over into the NBA the quickest?   JAN VESELY: I think the fast game, the running, defense; this I think.    Q. How do you think your skills will help the Wizards to rebuild?   JAN VESELY: How? I think, you know, we can work hard to win the games. I will do my best, of course, and I am ready to go to the Wizards.    Q. You were a teammate of Nenad Krstic. Talk about are you in touch with him on how to give you advice on how to make the adjustment to the NBA?  JAN VESELY: I'm not in touch with him. I never spoke to him.

Jonas, are you going to play this season immediately for Toronto, or are you going to wait a year just to refine things overseas?   JONAS VALANCIUNAS: I don't know. I don't know yet because the team -- my agent goes to conversation with my team, so we don't know yet, but we trying to have opportunities to go this year.    Q. Did you expect that Cleveland might take you with the fourth pick? Had you heard that previously?   JONAS VALANCIUNAS: I don't know. I don't expect no team to pick me. I just wanted to get drafted the highest possible, so that's it.    Q. What part of your game do you think would translate best in the American NBA-style game?  JONAS VALANCIUNAS: I don't know. I have all-around game, so I would like to translate that to NBA game, my game.   Q. If you play with AndrÃƒÂ© Bargnani, your games are somewhat similar, so talk about how well you'll work together, especially with the international experience you both have?   JONAS VALANCIUNAS: I don't think, he's kind of like power forward guy. So maybe he has better shooting. So maybe I'm better on rebounding. I don't know. We will be good.    Q. Talk about going to Toronto, which has a very international flavor, a lot of international players, do you think that will make the transition easier?  JONAS VALANCIUNAS: Yes, there's a lot of Lithuanian guys there. I think will help me in the NBA, so I like this situation.  \"}, 'Klay Thompson': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=72231', 'text': \"Q. Clay, your thoughts about being drafted by the Warriors?   KLAY THOMPSON: It's really humbling, just because I know how good the organization of the Warriors is and I can tell they are going in the right direction. Been watching basketball all my life, especially growing up in California. Just so thankful for this opportunity, I can't describe it. I can't wait to go up there and play for Coach Jackson; he's going to be demanding but he's going to get the most out of it.   Q. What are your thoughts on playing with Stephen Curry and what kind of backcourt do you think you guys can form?  KLAY THOMPSON: I'm extremely excited about it, because I see him play a lot and that kid can pass the ball. With us in the backcourt and me on the wing, I just think we'll be able to space the floor so well together, because you both shoot that ball. I'm excited to get up there and play with a point guard like him, because he has a good knowledge of the game and I know he'll get the most out of me, so I'm excited.   Q. Talk about what you heard from the Golden State Warriors in this process and how cool is it going to be for you to stay in California?   KLAY THOMPSON: It's too good to be true almost to stay close to him, especially with all of the family on the West Coast. I felt like they had a strong interest in me, just from when they saw me work out in Los Angeles and when they brought me up to Golden State and I had a pretty good workout in front of them.  I felt a strong vibe from them and I'm glad they stuck with it, because they made a good choice and I just want to prove that to them. I'm just really happy right now.   Q. A lot is said about Golden State's offense and how much firepower they have with that, but defensively what do you think they bring to the table that can help them with that end of the floor?   KLAY THOMPSON: I think, you know, there's room for improvement for me, but I've worked really hard my three years at Washington State and I think I just bring a big off-guard at 6-7 with his length that can even guard point guards at times, if I keep working on my foot speed. So just try to use my length to try to bother those smaller 2-guards in the league, so I'll keep working with that.    Q. Obviously your ability to shoot the ball really separates you from a lot of other guys, especially with your range and size, but your basketball acumen, coming from a basketball family and your ability to pass the ball, also, as an off-guard really separates you. Can you just talk about your ability to blend with Stephen Curry and not only to score, but to find other guys and that basketball IQ that a coach like Coach Jackson would appreciate?  KLAY THOMPSON: I think it would be a great asset for the Warriors, because I'm an unselfish player, I feel like. I can score but I can pass the ball, as well. I'll be out there just playing in the team concept and do whatever they need me to do, shoot, play make, whatever they need me to do. I'm a smart basketball player and I think I'll fit in pretty good with the team structure.  \"}, 'Tristan Thompson': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=72227', 'text': \"Q. What are your feelings about being drafted by Cleveland?   TRISTAN THOMPSON: It's an honor, I worked out with the Cavaliers two times. Me and the owners, the coaches, the players, it's a great environment and it's a franchise that wants to win, and I'm just so happy and fortunate to be selected by the Cleveland Cavaliers.    Q. Talk about competing with J.J. Hickson who is a talented young forward, also, how are you looking forward to elevating your skill set, working with him and practicing with him?  TRISTAN THOMPSON: It's going to be exciting. J.J. Hickson is a terrific basketball player. I feel that he's going to get me better in practice. He's been in the league for three years now. It's going to be fun in practice, and I'm excited.    Q. Tristan, the other day you were talking about how you wanted to dunk on Kyrie and now you could be playing with him. Talk about playing with Kyrie, and also the St. Patrick's/St. Benedict's connection?  TRISTAN THOMPSON: It's like we are reunited and Kyrie being from St. Pat's, a little Jersey rivalry, so I'm happy.   Q. Do you think taking two 19-year-olds will work out?   TRISTAN THOMPSON: I'm actually 20 right now.   Mr. Grant and Coach Scott, they felt Kyrie and myself were the best two choices for the organization, and we are going to come in and just give 100% and try to get better every day.    Q. Kyrie talked about you guys being drafted the same year and now you both can go through this, and your picks are so close together that it's a little relatable for you. What's this going to be like growing in your rookie year and doing it together as two of the Top-4 players in the Draft this season?   TRISTAN THOMPSON: Like you said, knowing that Kyrie, myself and Kyrie and myself, have friendship prior to the Draft; definitely having somebody there to support you and go through what you go through and almost like a brother to me, and will have my back and I'll have his, and we'll get through this together.    Q. When this process started, where you were ranked and you were projected -- you're the fourth pick today. How has that journey been and how does that feel?  TRISTAN THOMPSON: The journey has been exciting, meeting a lot of front offices and traveling to a lot of different cities. It's been a blessing in disguise. I know a lot of people never expected it and neither did myself. It just shows the wonders that hard work puts in.    Q. You knew there was a pretty strong chance you were going to be the highest-drafted Canadian ever. When did you start thinking maybe being this high was a realistic possibility?  TRISTAN THOMPSON: I thought it was realistic after the Cavs called me for a second workout and I thought, anything is possible, and I thought I could be the highest Canadian ever drafted.    Q. Kyrie was talking about how he and Coach Scott had talked about pushing the pace and running like old Lakers style, Showtime, how do you feel about pushing the pace and keeping a fast-paced offense in Cleveland?  TRISTAN THOMPSON: I love it. One of my strengths and attributes is getting up and down the floor and playing with Kyrie, it's going to be exciting.    Q. It seems like the Cavs have you and Kyrie as their new identity to build around. Can you speak about what identity you will bring and what identity the Cavaliers will have now?  TRISTAN THOMPSON: Myself the only thing I can bring to the table is a guy who plays hard and who gives 100% every day, he is those are my attributes, gives it all he's got and does what it takes to win.   Q. Can you talk a little bit about Samardo, how much did you play with him and how well do you know him?  TRISTAN THOMPSON: I played my whole sophomore year, he's like an older brother to me and a mentor, especially during this process, me and him have kept real close contact. He's went through many work outs just a year ago, so he just told me, just do what you do well and everything will fall into place.  \"}, 'Chris Singleton': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=72238', 'text': \"Q. Chris, if you could just start with an opening statement, feelings about being drafted by Washington.   CHRIS SINGLETON: It's totally a dream come true. I'm just glad I can sit here and to be in the presence of you guys right now. Not a lot of people get to do what I do on an everyday basis and not a lot of people get to have this experience, and I'm just glad I had it.    Q. Coincidentally Coach Hamilton coached the Washington franchise. So talk about what advice he will give to you to be able to adjust to the NBA, as well as the City of Washington.   CHRIS SINGLETON: He knows a lot of things about me. He knows I have a high basketball IQ. He knows that I can get up and down the court. We have the best playmakers, I feel like, the young playmakers. I feel like I'm going to fit in right off the bat. We have an up-and-coming team and we are going to try to push to the playoffs.   Q. Given the Knicks need for defense, did you think you would go to them as a possibility?   CHRIS SINGLETON: Yeah, my agent narrowed it down to me and a couple other guys, but they didn't pick me. It's life. It's a business. I know. That I can't take it to heart. I just got to go out there and play basketball.    Q. What do you feel like you're going to bring to the Washington Wizards? A lot of guys your size play your position. How do you carve out your niche for a team like the Wizards?   CHRIS SINGLETON: Right off the bat, it's just my defense right now. I'm a developing offensive player. Everybody knows that. My shot is getting better and my ball handling is getting better and my play handling is getting better. I feel like the team we have got, we are going to build that chemistry and just go over that hump.   Q. You've compared yourself to Scotty Pippen with some of the things you've done on the defensive end. Talk about that.   CHRIS SINGLETON: I grew up watching him and Magic mostly, and those are two guys that I just tried to emulate growing up. There's a lot of things that you have jet to see from me, I feel like, especially just in this game of basketball, it's a little different in college. I feel like this NBA level is something I was made for and something I dreamed about and something I'm going to take full advantage of.    Q. There are good, young, big men in Washington, AndrÃƒÂ© Blatche, as well as JaVale McGee. How are you looking forward to growing with those guys and they are pretty good defensive players themselves?   CHRIS SINGLETON: At the No. 6 pick, I feel like that was a good pick for our franchise. I feel like me and him, right after the bat, if he's able to come over here, I feel like we can contribute a lot to the team.   It's just that those guys, just being veterans, so to say, on the team, I feel like I can learn a lot from them. Those are special players and I feel like it's going to be good.    Q. Leonard Hamilton is known as a very good defensive mind. What did you learn from him that can help you as you adjust to playing defense in the NBA, as opposed to college?  CHRIS SINGLETON: Just you've got to dictate on defensive end. You can't always let the offensive player just get where he wants and like. That and you've got to scout teams. That's one thing we did a lot. We broke down teams and that's something that he said was going to be in the NBA and something I'm going to have to get used to.   I think he made me most prepared than any other spot I would have went to.   Q. When you worked out with the Wizards, did they give you an idea of what they are asking from you?  CHRIS SINGLETON: They just liked my overall game. In my workout, they saw what I'm capable of doing, especially with the ball. But just in terms of they know I'm going to bring my defense, and that's one thing that probably just put me in the position where I am today is my defense. I'm not going to take that for granted and I'm going to continue to work on that, and my offense is going to rise.  \"}, 'Darius Morris': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=72246', 'text': \"Q. Your thoughts on going to the Lakers?  DARIUS MORRIS: It's a dream come true, and I have to thank God for blessing me and bringing me a long way. And also Michigan and Coach and everyone else that has helped me to get here. When I heard my name finally called, it was a relief, but also at the same time, definitely put a chip on my shoulder, getting picked 41st, but that's just the story of my life. Never been a favorite, but always been one of the best. So I'm excited about the future.   Q. You come from a system with hard-nosed defense with Coach Beilein; how will you fit into this system?  DARIUS MORRIS: Very well. Defensively, the point guard has to set the tone on defense, and I'm excited about that. And also, our system, we do a lot of pick-and-roll, and Mike Brown is also familiar with that. So really excited. Definitely it's a great fit for me. I know people might frown because it's the second round, but ti's a great opportunity for me.   Q. Being a southern California kid, what does it mean to be drafted by the Lakers specifically?  DARIUS MORRIS: To be drafted by an L.A. powerhouse, I witnessed them do some great things and never in a million years did I think I was going to be playing for them or get drafted by them. Definitely a dream come true, to stay close to my family, something I didn't get to do for college.   Q. What they lacked in the post-season was a young point guard, and seems you could bring that to the table.  DARIUS MORRIS: Yeah, Derrick Fisher is a great player, has always produced in his career. A great player but I'm a little bit aller than him, and just provide a different look for them.   Q. Talk about the journey for you, how one door closed and another opened.  DARIUS MORRIS: It's very exciting. I put a lot of faith in God because the journey might lead you to a lot of different places that you don't even expect, like the Lakers, to return all the way back home, where it all started for my professional career. It's crazy. It's mind blowing. There's been a lot of ups and downs and they get me here and all my hard work paid off.   Q. Talk about crossing paths with Tobias.  DARIUS MORRIS: It was a little crazy because I ended his career and he's about to start a new one. Saw Bruce Pearl, it was a little ironic, but we are there together today, just both starting a new door.   Q. You grew up in Los Angeles, and now you're back there, but what did you learn going away to college across the country?  DARIUS MORRIS: Going away I learned a lot. I learned how to be a man, how to adapt on my own, and really overcome adversity when it was thrown at me. Now I'm ready. I'm able to come back home and be focused and be on a mission.   Q. Can you talk about being on the same team with Kobe and Derek Fisher, I think you were four or five when they were drafted. So tell me what that's going to be like.  DARIUS MORRIS: It's going to be wild. But I'm ready and it is crazy, watching those guys on TV, especially in L.A. Watching them win championships now to be with them, it really is a dream come true. So like I said, I can't wait to learn from those guys, they provide a lot of wisdom and I'm just ready to soak it in. \"}, 'Marcus Morris': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=72235', 'text': 'Q. Marcus, your thoughts on being drafted by the Rockets.   MARCUS MORRIS: I just told my brother, these were the two places that we both wanted end up at; if it wasn\\'t together, I wanted to be a Houston Rocket. From the first time I worked out, I got a great vibe from those guys and they told me how much they wanted me.    Q. Kevin McHale, coaching the Rockets, one of the greatest post players ever; how much are you looking forward to refining your game under his tutelage?  MARCUS MORRIS: A lot. From one of the best, to another post player, from Manning to Kevin McHale, two of the best. It\\'s definitely amazing for me and amazing for my family, and I\\'m just ready.   Q. What does it mean to be able to share this experience with your brother, and what will it feel like to not play with him for the first time?  MARCUS MORRIS: Definitely going to be weird. Definitely going to be weird. But we\\'re grown up. We\\'re grown men. I just told him that I was proud of him. Told him that I was proud of him, and I\\'m happy that he got to go where he wanted to be. Probably meant more to me than it meant to him when he got drafted.   He\\'s just my best friend, so I want him to do well.    Q. Any possible sibling rivalry? It meant he went one before you; does that mean --  MARCUS MORRIS: He was born before me, so it\\'s nothing new. Hopefully I can help Houston get over the hump and make the playoffs next year.    Q. Can you talk about you guys going back-to-back?   MARCUS MORRIS: Thanks, Philadelphia guy, for asking me a question. It\\'s just amazing. It\\'s just amazing how things play out. Just thanking God. He really has a plan for us. It just plays out the exact way we wanted it to. It\\'s just so amazing.    Q. Going to a Houston Rocket team that has a lot of offensive power, what do you bring to that team and how do you feel about playing with guys like Kevin Martin and Courtney Lee?  MARCUS MORRIS: I feel good about playing with those guys. I can feed off great players. I\\'m one of those guys that people didn\\'t worry about in college, and it\\'s just going to be to the fact where I\\'m just going to feed off of them and just add to their offense and just do other things, too.    Q. All week and through this whole process, you talked about even keel, no emotions. When did the emotions hit? Your brother broke down on his walk back here. Did they hit in the Green Room or have they hit yet?  MARCUS MORRIS: They definitely hit in the Green Room when Markieff got drafted. Like I said earlier, it meant a lot more to me than just me getting drafted and him getting drafted, because, I mean, we put in a lot of hard work, a lot of hard work. A lot of people don\\'t know how hard it is to come out of Philadelphia. I\\'m happy and happy I\\'m here.   Q. Speaking of Philadelphia and a rich tradition, how are you looking to enhance that tradition, as well as talking about what Sonny Hill has meant to you.   MARCUS MORRIS: Philly is on our back right now. We are going to try to bring Philly back. I have another Philly teammate in Kyle, and it\\'s funny, I texted Kyle right before the Draft and I said, \"Tell them whenever you can, get me over there,\" and he said to me, \"I\\'m trying, I\\'m trying,\" and it ended up in a good favor.  Philly is Philly. That\\'s my hometown. It made me what I am today.    Q. You guys are both going West; are you looking forward to going head-to-head?  MARCUS MORRIS: No. But, I mean, we\\'ve got to. I told him, how many times we play each other, maybe three? Three or four? Four? So I\\'m going to see him a lot. I hope I don\\'t have to guard him or he don\\'t have to guard me, but basketball is basketball, and we are both competitive guys, so we are both going to get after it.  '}, 'Markieff Morris': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=72234', 'text': \"Q. Markieff, if you can talk about being drafted by the Suns.   MARKIEFF MORRIS: I'm grateful. I'm thankful being put in this position, and I'm going to work my hardest every day and try to contribute to this Phoenix Suns team.    Q. I wanted to ask you, Phoenix had a shortage of big men, so how are you looking to contribute instantly with your size and versatility?  MARKIEFF MORRIS: You know, just being able to score the ball whenever they give it to me. Being able to be effective on the pick-and-roll with Steve, and definitely being able to bring my defensive presence.    Q. Talk about your emotions, going back-to-back with your brother.   MARKIEFF MORRIS: It's a great feeling. Once I was called, I still had a little, you know, a little pressure on me waiting for my brother to be called. Once he was called, it just came off, and we are both grateful and thankful.   Q. You mentioned playing with Steve Nash. The last three forwards that have played with him have gone on to be All-Stars. What's it like to be playing with a guy that makes everyone better?  MARKIEFF MORRIS: Definitely makes me better. He's a great player and he makes his bigs good. I think that me playing with him is going to make me a lot better and I'm just ready.    Q. You went 13, he went 14. Does that mean you bested him one-on-one every time?   MARKIEFF MORRIS: No, no, that's cool. You know, we are both drafted and we both told reporters out there, maybe when I'm 60, I'll tell him I got one up on him.   Q. Was it getting difficult just to sit there and watch the picks roll by?  MARKIEFF MORRIS: It was. But I'm drafted now, so I'm cool now.    Q. You broke down when I asked you about Dan Brinkley, the things that he did growing up for you; what did he do for you, you and your brother?  MARKIEFF MORRIS: He was definitely a father figure that I needed in my life at the time. He helped me and he promised me this, and it definitely meant a lot to us.   Q. When did you know you were going to the Suns? Were you just as surprised when they announced the pick?  MARKIEFF MORRIS: I was. I definitely didn't hear it. But you know, I definitely was happy when I heard it, because you know, it fits my playing style and it's a place that I definitely want to be.    Q. (Inaudible).  MARKIEFF MORRIS: They supported me coming out and making the decision to come out, but those guys that helped me get to this point that I am; and now they sit there with me in this celebration.   Q. You're going to be working with two classy individuals, two exceptional individuals in Steve Nash and Grant Hill; how much are you looking forward to picking their brains?  MARKIEFF MORRIS: I hope they are ready for me to pick their brains, because I'm going to be following those guys around all day trying to get the most out of them, and I'm just ready to be there with those guys.  \"}, 'Kawhi Leonard': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=72236', 'text': \"Q. Kawhi, what does it feel like?   KAWHI LEONARD: I feel great right now. I got picked to be on an NBA team. I worked hard. I finally accomplished my dream now, but it's not over yet. I've got a lot of work to do to make an impact in the league, and I'm ready to do any type of work I've got to do.    Q. There were reports that the Pacers and the Spurs have made a deal sending you to San Antonio; if true, how would you feel playing in San Antonio?  KAWHI LEONARD: I feel good. I had a meeting with them, and I got a great vibe from them. Just any team I'm on, I'm happy with right now. I'm just going in, trying to do whatever the coach wants me to do to make the team successful.    Q. If that report isn't correct, you're going to a Pacer team that has a lot of players of your position, small forwards. What can you do to separate yourself and get yourself on the floor?  KAWHI LEONARD: I can do a lot on the court. I'm very versatile. The coach drafted me, and he must have a plan in his head, and whatever his plan is, I'm ready for it.    Q. Your emphasis on rebounding in defense, talk about with the Pacers that, can get you immediate playing time, because they struggled on the defensive end, in the post, especially. Talk about how you're looking forward to that opportunity?  KAWHI LEONARD: Yeah, I take pride in defense, myself, I like my men to score the ball. I'm just going to go in, do the same thing I did in college, get some rebounds and help my teammates find ways to win games.  \"}, 'Brandon Knight': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=72229', 'text': \"Q. Brandon, if you can start with an opening statement, your feeling about being drafted by the Pistons?  BRANDON KNIGHT : I'm just happy I got picked by the Pistons. I had a great interview with them. I didn't have the chance to work out with them.    Q. Talk about playing with veterans like Tayshaun Prince, how much are you looking forward to being mentored?   BRANDON KNIGHT: Definitely looking forward to it. I'm someone that likes to learn, so I know that in Detroit, I'll be able to learn and get better, and that's one of my goals.   Q. How confident were you that you were going to be the next guard taken off the board after Kyrie got taken?  BRANDON KNIGHT: I was very confident. I just didn't know when it would be.    Q. In addition to veterans, you've got a lot of young guys, guys like Greg Monroe and guys like -- that are young players. How is that going to fit for you? Do you know any of those players? What do you feel like you're going to bring to the Pistons?  BRANDON KNIGHT: No, I don't personally know any of those players, but I think it will fit fine. I think every team has a way of finding a way to gel, and I'm sure we'll find a way to do that.  I just try to fit in just by working hard. That's what I've done every place I've been. I'm just going to work hard and give it a 110 percent.    Q. What was going through your mind when some of those guys went ahead of you in the 5, 6, 7 range? Did you think you would go higher than you did?  BRANDON KNIGHT: I did, but the Draft is inexact. You can't think about it. From now, it's just about making people pay that passed up on you. That's really what it's about.   Q. Were you surprised Detroit picked you since you did not work out for them?  BRANDON KNIGHT: I was kind of surprised. I didn't think it would come from them, but like I say, the Draft is inexact. You never know what's going to happen.    Q. What are your feelings on the Pistons, where they are at right now, and where do you see them possibly at the end of the season?  BRANDON KNIGHT: I know they are in a rebuilding stage trying to get back to previous form and winning championships. I want to be a part of that process and be a part of making the team better. I know they missed the playoffs the last couple of years, and I know I want to be part of that run trying to make the playoffs. \"}, 'Enes Kanter': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=72226', 'text': 'Q. Enes, when did you learn that the Jazz were going to draft you? I know you were pretty excited yesterday about it.   ENES KANTER: I was following mock drafts. I learned from there. I didn\\'t know until the last, David Stern.    Q. Have you gotten a chance to speak with Mehmet Okur and what has he told you about the organization?  ENES KANTER: First of all he told me about the Utah Jazz, and it\\'s a great city. It\\'s great and he has lots of fun there. And I\\'m so happy, because I have family there. You know, we are both from Turkey. And I believe when I go there, he will help me a lot, because we are both from Turkey. I will be so comfortable a lot and be playing center, he will be a big help for me to go there.    Q. Who are you looking forward to going up against to challenge yourself?   ENES KANTER: I mean, I love to play toughness. I love to get hit. I just love to play toughness. So it doesn\\'t matter who; I\\'m just going to put myself in the court 100%.    Q. Your international success with the Hoop Summitt, as well as the European Basketball Championships, Under 18, your dominance, how will that translate to the next level, being able to dominate everywhere you\\'ve been?   ENES KANTER: First of all, I couldn\\'t play college. So in Hoops Summitt, I knew I had to show myself 100%. But before the game, I wasn\\'t sure if I was going to play or not, because I got hit and I got hurt, first practice.   And after that, I talked to Coach about Hoop Summitt and about getting myself -- I said, \"Coach, I\\'m not sure if I\\'m going to play or not.\"   He said, \"Go ahead and warm up.\" Before the game, I took four painkiller and just showed myself 100%, and I just showed myself, because I knew I had NCAA problems, so that\\'s why I just tried to show myself 100%.    Q. Unlike a lot of these guys in the Draft, most people have not seen you play. What\\'s your game? What\\'s it going to be in the NBA? What are you like as a player?  ENES KANTER: I mean, first of all, I hate to lose and I love to play toughness. I love to play a tough game. And I will say back to basket and rebounds, but right now, I\\'m working on my shot and face-up game.    Q. It appeared on TV you were going to dedicate this season to Kentucky fans; is that what you said and if so, why?   ENES KANTER: That\\'s true. First of all, they support me a lot. They are so special to me. You know, they will always be in my heart. It was so sad and frustrating. I couldn\\'t play for them, and I just -- I still want to like help them, because they support me a lot. Just like they made \"Free Enes\" T-shirts. They just did everything for me and I just want to support them.  '}, 'Kyrie Irving': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=72223', 'text': 'Q. You talked about being here two years ago and you told your stepmother that this was going to happen. How was tonight compared to what you thought was going to happen, and did you ever have any thoughts about going No. 1?  KYRIE IRVING: I didn\\'t have any doubts about going to No. 1. I was looking to the organization to pick who they felt was the right choice. But now to this moment, from being a fan of the NBA Draft and now being drafted, it\\'s a special feeling in my heart and knowing that my friends and family were together, it\\'s a memory I\\'m going to remember for the rest of my life.   Q. Based on the comments you made with your desire to play for your native Australia, Basketball Australia issued a statement overnight saying that if you\\'re willing to go the extra mile to clear the extra hurdles, they are, too. Are you willing to do that? Do you want to and have you talked to Coach K about it?  KYRIE IRVING: Right now I\\'m in discussion with the head coach, Brett Brown and we have been talking for a while about me transitioning from the USA to playing for Australia but it\\'s a position that\\'s not going to be made right now. Like I said, we are in conversation. I have not talked to Coach K about it. That will be a decision that I will make further down the road.    Q. How do you think you\\'ll fit into Byron Scott\\'s offense? I know you\\'ve talked about wanting to play a lot of pick-and-roll in the NBA.   KYRIE IRVING: Oh, definitely. Just the way Coach Scott, what he did for Chris Paul and his transition into the NBA, he made it a lot easier, and I kind of want to emulate that journey of Chris Paul and transitioning to his offense, which is up-tempo and just run. When I was out in Cleveland, all he said he wants to do is just run, like he did when he played for the Lakers in \\'86. When they made the run with Magic with the point, that\\'s how I want it, just up-and-down.    Q. Considering you played your high school ball like 20 minutes down the road and now you\\'re getting drafted No. 1 in the league right here in Newark, what kind of emotions are there?  KYRIE IRVING: Honestly, I\\'m really holding myself back from really letting all my emotions out. I\\'m excited now knowing that I have to share this experience with my old teammates, and some of my Duke teammates are here, and getting this experience, it\\'s a once-in-a-lifetime and it\\'s an honor to be drafted especially No. 1 as a point guard I know I\\'m in good company, only five point guards in the last 35 years have been drafted No. 1, so I\\'m in good company.    Q. When you see some of the names that are No. 1 picks, what goes through your mind? It\\'s NBA royalty to be the No. 1 pick.   KYRIE IRVING: That I\\'ve got some big shoes to fill. No. 1 picks, they have a lot of expectations on them and I plan on exceeding them. Being No. 1 pick is an honor and I\\'m really looking forward to getting on the court and showing I didn\\'t was picked No. 1.   Q. You were there the night that Cleveland got to the No. 1 pick. Did you go home that night, try looking up Cleveland, try to learn as much as you can, especially with all of the expectations that you probably were going No. 1?   KYRIE IRVING: Well, I had information on all of the organizations that were in the lottery. I was best prepared for whoever got the No. 1 pick. I was glad it was Cleveland and I\\'m glad that they picked me.  That night after the lottery, I really thought long and hard about it, and any do -- if Cleveland actually does pick me, I could not really envision myself getting drafted but now that it\\'s actually here, it\\'s the greatest feeling in the world.    Q. Obviously last year, the Cavaliers franchise and their fans went through a big hit with LeBron leaving. How excited are you and how much pressure do you put on yourself to go to Cleveland to rebuild what they had established there before LeBron left?  KYRIE IRVING: One, I\\'m really not looking to replace LeBron honestly, just try to be Kyrie Irving and just contribute to the Cleveland organization as much as I can. I\\'m looking forward to getting to Cleveland. It\\'s a big sports town and I cannot wait to embrace all of the fans there and the fan support, I can\\'t wait. Having the chance to see my jersey out in the crowd with all of those Cleveland fans, that\\'s something I\\'m really looking forward to.    Q. How much are you looking forward to playing with Baron Davis and learning from a veteran point guard?  KYRIE IRVING: It will be a great experience. He can only help me, just coming into the NBA as a fresh face and a rookie, I can only learn from him.  Whether we play aside each other or vice versa, one plays in front of the other, it will all be to help me. So I can only grow in the Cleveland organization having a point guard that\\'s already been in the NBA for a number of years. It\\'s a great opportunity for me to learn from the best.    Q. You mentioned yesterday that you\\'ve been talking to LeBron and Chris Paul, and taking notes from them ever since you were kind of a kid on how to be a pro. Can you talk a little bit more about that and what you\\'ve learned from those people how to conduct yourself in this league?   KYRIE IRVING: Well, I didn\\'t really start befriending them until I got into high school and I started going to their camps and I got to know them a little bit. When I was younger I used to watch countless hours of video of both of them working out. When I say, try to emulate their journey, just the way they transitioned themselves, LeBron coming from high school into the NBA and Chris Paul coming from college into the NBA, and the way they conducted themselves on and off the court, is truly as a professional should. A lot of community service, just taking care of the family and that\\'s kind of how I envision myself.   This is a position I\\'ve been waiting all my life for, and having the opportunity to take care of my family and my friends, and actually doing what I love every single night is something I\\'ve been looking forward to for a long time.    Q. What skill do you think you learned at Duke under Coach K that will serve you best in the National Basketball Association?   KYRIE IRVING: Well, I truly believe that Duke is a professional program. The way we prepare, practice, we practice like professionals and that\\'s what he taught me and that\\'s what I\\'m going to carry to the next level is how to prepare like a professional: Countless hours of film, breaking things down in practice, preparing for the next team, thoroughly. There\\'s not one team that I thought we were unprepared for, even when I was hurt.   So being a part of the Duke program and shadowing the coaches when I was hurt, I really learned a lot how to prepare like a professional. When I was playing it was a little different, because things were happening really fast. But when I was hurt, things -- it slowed down for me. So I really got a chance to learn from them, learn from the coaches especially.   Q. What stood out to you most during that visit to Cleveland?   KYRIE IRVING: Just the amount of pressure I was under, because it was the only team I was going to go work out for. That workout really had a lot of pressure, and the aura in the air, it was filled with a lot of intensity. And you could see in Coach Scott\\'s eyes, he probably won\\'t admit it, but we played a shooting game and I beat him. He probably won\\'t admit it. (Laughter).  It was fun and it was intense at the same time. I did all of the testing that I did not do in Chicago, which was good, because I wanted to test myself against the best. When we worked out, I think it went really well, also.   Q. First of all, congratulations. There\\'s a lot said about when you knew. When did you know that you were going to be a Cleveland cavalier?  KYRIE IRVING: I knew when everybody else knew. They gave me no indication that they were going to pick me. I was really nervous sitting at that table with my family and my friends.   I found out when everyone else found out and I\\'m glad I\\'m a Cleveland cavalier.    Q. Have you had a chance to meet Dan Gilbert, and what were your impressions if you have?  KYRIE IRVING: He\\'s a really smart man, and honestly, he has a plan prepared for the next -- for the future.   You know, when I met him, he\\'s a great owner, and he\\'s not afraid to go out and get players to surround -- to get in the organization. I\\'m really happy I\\'m a part of the Cleveland organization. He\\'s a great owner and I\\'m really looking forward to getting to Cleveland and embracing it.   Q. Who are you most looking forward to playing against in the NBA? Is there one guy in the league that you\\'re like, okay, \"I admire that player and look forward to playing against him\"?  KYRIE IRVING: I\\'m just really looking forward to playing against everybody. I really dreamed about playing on the floor with great players, and I\\'m playing with the best of the best every night.   You know, one night, I\\'ll have Kobe, and the next night I\\'ll have Kevin Martin and the next night I\\'ll have Stephen Curry. All of these players that I\\'ve really grown up and been fond of and now they are going to be competitors with me, so I\\'m really looking forward to that.    Q. Did you get a chance to talk to Coach Boyle today and what did he say to you?  KYRIE IRVING: I didn\\'t get a chance to talk to Coach Boyle. He texted me earlier and congratulated on this opportunity of mine. I\\'ll probably talk to him a little later, but he played a big influence on my career.    Q. Obviously we just saw Tristan Thompson come off the board. What do you think of him joining you in Cleveland?  KYRIE IRVING: I\\'m really looking forward to it. Tristan is a great friend of mine, and just having another fellow freshman being drafted to Cleveland, I\\'m really looking forward to it, and playing with him -- I\\'m really excited. I was looking over there while I was trying to listen to the question at the same time. (Laughter).  I\\'m really excited having a fellow -- he\\'s 19, also, and he\\'s a young player, and having somebody alongside you that will go through the rookie ups and downs with you, it will make the transition into the NBA that much easier.    Q. Can you tell us who was at the table with you? Your dad and your agent and who else?   KYRIE IRVING: It was my dad, my sister, my agent, and two of my best friends.

To get to this point has been my dream since I was a little kid, and it's come true. To play for the Kings, I think is going to be a great situation for me.    Q. Tyler, congratulations on being drafted. The Kings have a lot of players at the 3 and everything, so how are you looking to really be able to differentiate your skill-set to get major minutes?   TYLER HONEYCUTT: Just play my game. I think I can play the two or the 3. Just do what I do best and let the coaches take it from there.    Q. Can you talk about what the draft process was like for you? Because when you came out, there was some surprise, but obviously you impressed some people. Was there a turning point in all this?  TYLER HONEYCUTT: No, there wasn't any turning point. I just took a lot of time after we lost to make my decision and once I knew that was what I wanted to do, I was 100% on that. I don't regret anything, though.    Q. Being part of a wide-open offense, in Sacramento, Coach Paul Westphal, how much are you looking forward to that, coming out of a system that was a little more half-court oriented?   TYLER HONEYCUTT: I think more athletic players and being even younger, you know, the tempo is probably going to pick up, and young guys are going to play off each other.    Q. Can you talk about the decision to come here? Obviously this is a special day; were you happy where you got picked? Clearly you probably wanted to go higher, but were you happy?  TYLER HONEYCUTT: Definitely at the end of the day, I liked the situation. I expected to go higher, but it is what it is. Just want to show that a lot of people made a lot of mistakes. \"}, 'Tobias Harris': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=72245', 'text': \"Q. Your thoughts about being drafted by the Bucks and also being a local guy?  TOBIAS HARRIS: I think it's a great honor to be drafted by the Milwaukee Bucks. I think it's a great honor to be drafted by the Milwaukee Bucks.  I just feel like it's a great fit for me as a player, coming in and bringing a winning attitude and just a great work ethic to the table. I believe that we have a great organization, and we are on the rise to doing big things in the conference, and being a hometown kid from New York, getting to go to this draft, and being in front of all my family and friends and fans, and get drafted is just a great opportunity and is just a blessing from God.   Q. What are some of the adjustments you're going to have to make from college ball?  TOBIAS HARRIS: Definitely tempo is a lot faster, so I'll just continue to grow as a player and person, and continue to work hard. Defense is going to be a lot harder, so I'm just going to have to really push myself to the limit.   Q. Just explain a little bit about the anticipation while you were waiting for where you finally were going to end up?  TOBIAS HARRIS: There was a lot of anticipation. I didn't really know where I was going to go. Sitting there, you're just really anxious, but I knew God has a plan for me, whichever situation I was going to go to. I just sit there and let that rest in His hands.   Q. Talk about how college ball prepared you for the NBA.  TOBIAS HARRIS: Prepared me a lot. Our team faced a lot of adversity this year, just taught me to continue to grow as a player and person, and just continue to work hard and be the best at what I do. So it taught me a lot and I learned a lot from our coaches and our team.   Q. There is a good depth of threes in Milwaukee, so how are you looking to be able to get some big time minutes early, and how will you separate yourself?  TOBIAS HARRIS: Just come in there and work as hard as I can and just learn a lot and continue to grow as basketball player, and you know, just really work my tail off. \"}, 'Jimmer Fredette': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=72242', 'text': 'Q. If you\\'ll just start with an opening statement.   JIMMER FREDETTE: Obviously Sacramento King, officially. Took a little while waiting back there. But it\\'s a great moment for me and for my family, and for the Sacramento Kings organization. Hopefully their fan base is excited because I\\'m really excited to get out there and start the season with them and have a great year. So I\\'m looking forward to it.    Q. Talk about how playing with a big guard like Tyreke Evans can really bring out your skill set, especially as a perimeter shooter?  JIMMER FREDETTE: Definitely, he\\'s a slashing guard and able to get into the lane, very physical guy who can guard the point and the two, because he is so big. So that\\'s an advantage. Hopefully I think we\\'ll be able to play really, really well together.   Like I said, it\\'s a young team, young nucleus of guys they have out there. But we are an exciting team that likes to get up-and-down and score the basketball, so it\\'s a great fit.    Q. The crowd was going crazy for you, and the type of reaction you\\'ve been getting with the media attention, does it almost feel like that you feel like the No. 1 pick with everything that\\'s surrounding you?  JIMMER FREDETTE: No, not necessarily. I\\'m still the No. 10 pick, but Top-10 pick is a great thing still. I think a lot of it just has to do with this last year in college, how things exploded and the media just really took a hold of our season and myself, and it\\'s continuing. Everyone was really anxious and didn\\'t know where I was going to go. I was all over the draft boards, and people were just excited to see about it, as was I. So I think that was a big part of it.    Q. What was this wait like? That was like two and a half hours from Draft to here. How hard was that?  JIMMER FREDETTE: It took a long time, but it\\'s something you\\'ve got to do. They just wouldn\\'t let you out of the room until the trade was official, and I wish it could have been a little bit earlier. I have friends and family that I\\'m going to go see and hang out with after this, so that\\'s what happens sometimes.    Q. Can you talk about what your brand in the \"Follow Jimmer\" and all of the YouTube stuff and media stuff, how will you continue to that as you hopefully make it to a successful NBA career?  JIMMER FREDETTE: Well, now it\\'s over today. This is the last day of the \"Follow Jimmer\" YouTube thing. We\\'ll sell the rights to people and we\\'ll be in the works with that. But today was the last day of the documentary. It was a good thing. This last month they just hit some key points of what I was doing, and it shows what a college basketball player has to go through to get into the NBA.   So it\\'s a cool thing. I think people really enjoyed it, but it\\'s over today.    Q. I saw you took a peek up at the \"Jimmer Jam\" celebration. What did it feel for you to be able to see that your hometown was excited for you and cheering for you back home?  JIMMER FREDETTE: It\\'s great. It\\'s great to have that support back home. It\\'s obviously where I grew up and was raised my whole entire life, and I\\'ll never forget the people that helped me get to this position where I am today. So it\\'s very, very exciting for myself and everybody back in Glen Falls, and I\\'m glad that they are still supporting me.   Q. What\\'s going to be the next step for you in terms of preparing yourself for the season? Obviously there could be a lockout. How do you plan to spend any time off?  JIMMER FREDETTE: I\\'m just going to continue to do it just as if there it was going to be a season starting right on time. You\\'ve just got to continue to work hard, and work on the things that I need to get better at. So I don\\'t think anything is going to change for me as far as my workouts. I\\'m still going to do the best that I possibly can to get prepared to play for the Kings, and have the season start -- if the season starts on time, that would be great and hopefully it does. That\\'s what I\\'m looking forward to.    Q. Does it make you smile when you see that makeshift contract that you drew up with your brother and everybody is posting now?  JIMMER FREDETTE: Yeah, definitely. It\\'s a little thing that just helped to keep my mind straight, and every night before I went to bed, I saw it and dreamed about being an NBA basketball player. First thing you have to do if you have a goal is to write it down, and that\\'s what we did. And T.J. was a big influence on my life, and that was just one of the many things that he did for me to help me get to this position. It\\'s just a cool thing and people really like it.   Q. A lot of people kept saying \"Utah\" for you in the mock drafts; where did you see yourself going before this day, and also, when did Sacramento come into it where you thought that that was a possibility?   JIMMER FREDETTE: When they made the trade to No. 10, I thought that was a possibility for sure. We worked out with five teams and I thought I would land with one of those five teams and I worked out with Sacramento, so I knew I had a shot. They liked me out there, the Maloofs and Coach and Petrie, they liked me. So I had a pretty good workout and I knew it was a possibility, and now it\\'s a reality.    Q. Could you talk more about the Maloofs, and just what you envision in Sacramento moving forward?  JIMMER FREDETTE: Yeah, definitely. Like I said, the style of play that I like, up-tempo system, ball screens, I like to score the basketball. So it plays right into my style of play. That\\'s how I\\'ve played my whole entire life at college and in high school.   So this is no different. So hopefully we can get out there and have a great team. Be able to excite the fans and get more wins this year.    Q. Tongue-in-cheek question: Do you have any plans to run for President of the United States or will you stay with basketball for now?  JIMMER FREDETTE: No, I\\'m definitely going to stick with basketball for now. The popularity is not quite there yet. But I\\'ll stay with the basketball for a while.    Q. As you\\'re going through your workouts, you talked about wanting to prove that you have the athletic ability to play at the NBA level; was it frustrating for you that those questions persisted? Seemed like you were running into a stereotype, quite frankly, that was working against you.   JIMMER FREDETTE: Yeah, that was definitely something I wanted to focus on in these workouts. I had a perception and it\\'s something that I had to go out and prove. People had to see that in order to believe it, and you know, I thought I did a pretty good job of it in the workouts and that\\'s why I think I was able to be picked in the Top-10. I thought the workouts were great for me and my family to be in this position right now.    Q. Sacramento was able to keep the Kings for one more year; so do you think your addition could be able to really keep the Kings there for awhile with bringing fans to the arena to see you?  JIMMER FREDETTE: Maybe. I haven\\'t heard too much about it. I know they are going to be there were one more year and see how it goes. I hope the fans come out and support us. I hope they like our team. I think we will have a very exciting team and like I said, I hope we can get more wins. Winning translates to getting more fans out there, and hopefully we\\'ll be able to keep the organization there.

KENNETH FARIED: First, I want to thank Allah for the Nuggets being able to draft me and being in the first rounds and I want to thank my dad and my daughter just for getting me over that hump.    Q. Talk about going to the Denver Nuggets, playing under George Karl and Kenyon Martin is a free agent and most likely they are not going to sign him, talk about how you can make an immediate impact on the defensive ends and the glass?  KENNETH FARIED: I plan on making an immediate impact because I'm a relentless person with a work hard ethic and since they are not signing Kenyon Martin, hopefully I can come in and fill that void. But he's a great player and it's going to be really hard but I'm going to push myself to get to that point.   Q. Did you work out for the Nuggets, and did you have a sense that there was a chance that they could take you?   KENNETH FARIED: Yeah, I worked out for them and I had a great sense they was going to take me. It wasn't really a long shot them taking me because of the fact that I played up there and they know how I played, I played really well even though the high altitude and when I did go to work out for them, I played even better and it just seemed to be the right fit for me.    Q. What does it mean to you as a Newark native to be drafted in the NBA at the Prudential Center with your family on hand watching?  KENNETH FARIED: Once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for me overall. My family, just for being here and my family being able to watch, and a lot of my family, just to basically take a bus ride down to come see me get drafted is a great feeling to have and your supporters and everybody is just cheering. It was overwhelming.    Q. Could you ever have envisioned four years ago before you went to Morehead State that you would have this moment?   KENNETH FARIED: I had a vision I was going to have this moment, but I didn't know what team or I didn't know if it was going to be in the first round, but I just believed that I was going to be able to get to the NBA, because that was my biggest dream and I wasn't going to let it live down and I was going to keep pushing myself and finally this moment is here.    Q. Talk about what you've heard from the Denver Nuggets, what they said to you during the workout process, and how do you feel like you're going to fit?   KENNETH FARIED: It's kind of funny when we did do the workout, the coaches after the workout was with me in the gym and we were just shooting and they were showing me certain post moves and shots. It's really different defending in the NBA. I didn't know certain things and they were showing me that, and when I learned that, I went to my next workout and utilized what I learned so...   It was kind of funny that they drafted me, because we were in the gym working on a lot of things.    Q. I hate to be the downer, but are any of the prospects talking about the labor situation, when you guys were just meeting the last couple of days?  KENNETH FARIED: We don't really say too much about it. We were just trying to get to this point to get drafted. Everybody was just talking about the workouts and how tough they were and how everybody was going to push each other and be happy for each other and just get to this point tonight.   Q. Did your family actually ride the bus to watch the Draft and how far away from here did you grow up?  KENNETH FARIED: Probably about, I would say, I say two miles, but that's me, because I've been around here a lot, but it's probably about ten miles away.   Probably some of them, I really don't know. But my mom and stuff, we took a car service, but that's a different story.    Q. Express how special it was to bring Morehead State out to the national landscape, especially winning over Louisville and just leaving a substantial legacy behind with Morehead State.   KENNETH FARIED: It was extremely special for me, and my school, and my coaches, and just overall, everybody at Morehead State, even some people in New Jersey, basically they were so happy because I was on that stage and I was a hometown native, and just for us to upset Louisville was even more ecstatic for the people in Kentucky, period.    Q. Who is with you tonight? Who was sitting there in your section?   KENNETH FARIED: My mom, my dad, my daughter, my grandmother, and my mom.    Q. Were you surprised -- because you're from here and you were projected to be a first round pick -- that you did not get invited to the Green Room?   KENNETH FARIED: It was a little surprise, a little depressed, but just made my chip on my shoulder grow a little bit more, and it's just going to make me push myself that much harder to be hopefully be invited to the All-Star Game and things like that.  \"}, 'Alec Burks': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=72232', 'text': \"Q.

Just happy to make the Utah Jazz a stop on my journey.    Q. You were more confident than people thought; what did you know and how did this unfold that you are now playing for this team?  ALEC BURKS: I had a great workout, I showed my complete game, an improved jumpshot and at the Draft tonight, I saw the way the picks was going and I felt there was a chance the Utah Jazz was going to get me, and it happened.    Q. Talk about this journey, how this process has gone, all of the teams, everything that's been said; to finally be drafted in the NBA?  ALEC BURKS: It's been great but a grind at the same time. It's been a long month of June it seemed like. But I just worked hard. It's been a blessing. I'm just glad I finally know who I'm playing for.    Q. Have you watched any Jazz games last year and if so, what do you think of the pieces in place?  ALEC BURKS: I really didn't watch that much. I was a state over in Colorado, but they have good players and a good coach, so I feel like I can't wait to be a part of it.    Q. You're a slashing guard, but what do you still have to do to take it to a NBA level?  ALEC BURKS: I feel like it's getting better every day and more consistent than people give me credit for.

MARSHON BROOKS: Just look forward to going in there and just trying to help them anyway possible. They have a really good point guard in Deron Williams, it's going to make life easy for me and I'm just looking forward to helping him.   Q. Who did you grow up a fan of?   MARSHON BROOKS: I was born in New Jersey, but I was raised in Atlanta, but I was always a Shaq fan growing up early. So I was an Orlando fan and once he got traded to the Lakers, that's when I started becoming a Lakers fan, and that's when I started liking Kobe, as well.    Q. Tell us about not just your ability to score at will, but also talk about your versatility. You have a lot of versatility; how will that contribute to the team that you'll be with?   MARSHON BROOKS: First of all, I can score a lot of different ways, because of my childhood, growing up playing point guard most of my life. The ball used to being under my hand, I'm able to create my own shot without a ball screen or without an off-screen or anything. And playing at Providence, I think that just got me ready for the future.    Q. If there was a sleeper pick in the second round, if you were a GM and you had a choice, could you name one player that you would think of as a sleeper?  MARSHON BROOKS: Andrew Goudelock.   Q. Has this whole week leading up to the Draft been emotional and kind of nerve-wracking for you, wondering what's going to happen, wondering where your life is going to be over the next couple of years or decade or however long you're in the NBA?  MARSHON BROOKS: Oh, yeah, it definitely was. It was real tough on me honestly, just not knowing. That's the main thing, just not knowing. You hear a lot of different things. The Draft is very unique, and as you see this year, a lot of different things happening that nobody expected, and I just look forward to helping New Jersey.    Q. You played in the BIG EAST, and you were able to score all of those points in the BIG EAST. Talk about how that competition is going to prepare you for the next level day in, day out, playing great teams.   MARSHON BROOKS: I think, yeah, definitely, the BIG EAST from a competitive level is definitely, bar none, the best. And on top of that, playing in the BIG EAST, when you play 16 teams, you play so many different styles each night. I think I'll be ready for anything the league has to throw at me, but I just look forward to it. It's a dream come true.   Q. What role do you see yourself playing with the Nets next season?  MARSHON BROOKS: Anything they need me to do. I have played a lot of different roles in my four years at Providence, but like I said, Providence just has me so ready for this situation that I'm in right now and I mean, I like to score the ball. That's what I like to do. But I'm willing to do extra.    Q. How familiar are you with the Nets right now?  MARSHON BROOKS: With the Nets? They didn't have too many TV games but I've watched a lot of basketball and I'm pretty familiar with the Nets. Do you want me to tell you the starting five? (Laughter).   Q. What's your impression?  MARSHON BROOKS: Team on the rise. Definitely a team with new management that's just trying to get to the top.    Q. How was it for your family this week? You've had quite a few around you the last couple of days.   MARSHON BROOKS: It was huge. It was definitely huge for me, to be living my dream, and just my whole family. I'm pretty sure they can't wait for me to leave this interview right now, but especially my mom, raising me by herself, and not the best neighborhood. She was my mom and my dad. So hats off to her first.    Q. Talk about coming to the end of this experience. You were traveling all over the place and meeting all of these different teams and hearing a lot of different rumors. How does it feel that you're finally done and you don't know where you're going to be, but you will be somewhere next year?   MARSHON BROOKS: It's definitely a great feeling. Like I said, I've been waiting on this, and it has not just started these last couple of months, even though it was nerve-wracking for me the last couple of months.

I'll a free agent right now, you know, after I leave the team, going to the Hoop Summitt, they didn't want to let me go.

How closely did you watch the NBA this season, knowing you were coming here, and whose games did you watch the closest? Was it the people at your position?   BISMACK BIYOMBO: I watched a lot of games about the NBA, but I have no people I can compare my game to them. People might say that I'm looking like some players, but it's not that way.

Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Now that you know you're going to Cleveland, what is it about the organization that stands out to you? DION WAITERS:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Just the fan base, the crowd.Ã‚Â\\xa0 They come to every game and they support the city, and it's a great city.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I was there my freshman year and played in a tournament there.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Calm city, quiet, things like that.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 And of course playing with Kyrie Irving ‑‑ DION WAITERS:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I'm excited to play alongside my brother.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I've known him for six or seven years, and we have been texting and talking forever.Ã‚Â\\xa0 He was the first person that greeted me off the stage and gave me a hug and told me, welcome to Cleveland.Ã‚Â\\xa0 That meant a lot to me.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Wanted to ask you about how Cleveland has been progressing the last couple of years under Byron Scott.Ã‚Â\\xa0 How much are you looking forward to helping him continue that progression? DION WAITERS:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I just want to do whatever I have to do to help us win.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Coach, he's been here before and he's played in the NBA, so it's my job to pick his brain as much as I can to get better in the league and just work hard and try to get wins, and one day get a championship.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Just keep taking steps, moving forward.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 It's a lot of conversation about having a big 3; Kyrie, 1, and then you, 2.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Does that come across in your mind to say, hey, I'm the second one, or we can get a third one, and then after that, community service opportunities, they are big in Cleveland for athletes.  DION WAITERS:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Yeah, you know, we've got to play together, a group of guys who is willing to win, play with each other.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I just can't wait to play alongside Kyrie, because I know he can help me.Ã‚Â\\xa0 He's been here before.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I'm going to try to just pick his brain as much as I can, also.  Moving forward, whatever Cleveland decides to do with the Draft or free agency, whatever, try to get another player, I'm fine with it.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 About a month ago, we sat in a gym and you told me, no, I'm trying to go top five, and I shook my said; what did you know then that I didn't?  DION WAITERS:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Confidence.Ã‚Â\\xa0 It's confidence.Ã‚Â\\xa0 You really can't listen to a lot of people because you never know what can happen in certain situations.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Somebody telling me I'm going 15 to 20, I don't listen to that.Ã‚Â\\xa0 So it's all about hard work and knowing what you put in.  You know, just believing, and just thanking the Man above every day for putting me in the position I'm in today.  Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 You thought you were moving up yesterday; was there any surprise that it was 4?  DION WAITERS:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I mean, yeah, and no, at the same time.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Because like I said, you never know in these situations.Ã‚Â\\xa0 You never know especially for a guy that has not worked out for anybody.Ã‚Â\\xa0 The only thing you can do is go by what you hear.Ã‚Â\\xa0 My agent has been giving me good feedback and the only thing I can do is keep believing, keep my hopes up and things like that.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 It was kind of unconventional to make the decision to not work out for any team.Ã‚Â\\xa0 So explain how your agent explained that to you and why you guys made that decision.  DION WAITERS:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Anything he tells me you can't question.Ã‚Â\\xa0 He's been in this game for a long time, and I've got a lot of faith in both of them.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I think that whatever he told me, it was best for me.Ã‚Â\\xa0 He told me he thinks I should shut it down and just go home and work hard, and that's what I did.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I'm here today and I'm thankful for listening to him.  \"}, 'Tornike Shengelia': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=81074', 'text': \"Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Could you start with an opening statement, feelings about being drafted by Philadelphia?

The only one thing I can say is I'm really glad to get drafted by the Philadelphia 76erseses.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Philadelphia was one game away from reaching the Eastern Conference Finals, and so they are a young team on the upswing.Ã‚Â\\xa0 How are you looking forward to contribute to their continued success?  TORNIKE SHENGELIA:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I would bring a lot of energy on the court.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I can be a role player, too.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I can score a basket.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I can play on defense.Ã‚Â\\xa0 So I would do everything I can.Ã‚Â\\xa0 It's my type of play.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Did you work out for the 76ers or go meet them or anything? TORNIKE SHENGELIA:Ã‚Â\\xa0 No, I didn't work out.   Q. Ã‚Â\\xa0Had you had any discussions or talked to people?

TERRENCE ROSS:Ã‚Â\\xa0 It's just a real moment.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I still don't feel like any of this is happening.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I feel blessed to be here, and I think it just shows all of the hard work I put in.Ã‚Â\\xa0 So I'm just happy to be where I'm at.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Talk about what you went through with your maturity and leadership in the two years under Coach Lorenzo Romar.  TERRENCE ROSS:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I think my freshman year, coming to a group that's already playing together for two or three years, and being only freshmen, I think it really helped my game.Ã‚Â\\xa0 It made me go through life faster, and they told me a bunch of things and I soaked it up like a sponge.  Going into my sophomore year, all of the hard work I put in and how hard I played, and getting all of the information from the seniors, that really helped me in the long run.  Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 A couple of months ago we were talking and you said you had no idea where you would get drafted; did you think you would go this high, No.8? TERRENCE ROSS:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I didn't think I would go this high, but I'm happy I am.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I know I can make an impact at the next level, and I'm just happy to be where I'm at.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Starting small forward for the Toronto Raptors?  TERRENCE ROSS:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Probably shooting guard.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Can you talk about your workout in Toronto and did you think this was a possibility?Ã‚Â\\xa0 Also DeMar DeRozan is there, how do you think that dynamic will work?  TERRENCE ROSS:Ã‚Â\\xa0 The workout in Toronto went really well for me.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I did a lot of things really well, got to the basket, shot well, defended really well.  Playing with DeMar, he's going to help me a lot.Ã‚Â\\xa0 He's been in the league a couple of years and all of his knowledge, I'll just soak it up and I think he'll make me a better ballplayer.Ã‚Â\\xa0 He's the best they have and it will be really be good for me.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 You're not going to be the only rookie for the Raptors next year, they will be getting Jonas Valanciunas, the center.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I don't know how much you know about him but what's that going to be like getting to go through this experience with another rookie, a high‑end pick and what's it going to be like playing with a big guy like that? TERRENCE ROSS:Ã‚Â\\xa0 It's going to be fun.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I know he's going to bring a lot to the team and I'm just happy there's going to be another guy coming with me.Ã‚Â\\xa0 It will be scary for me to go somewhere by myself but having another rookie will help me and help him at the same time.Ã‚Â\\xa0 We are going to learn a lot from each other and I think we are going to have a good time.  Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 When you started this process, you were probably in the second half of the first round, now you're pick No.8.Ã‚Â\\xa0 When did you start to realize that, hey, I could kind up going to the lottery and maybe even the Top‑10?  TERRENCE ROSS:Ã‚Â\\xa0 It's hard to say.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I didn't think I would be getting an invite to the lottery as late as I did, and when I did, I just knew that I'm going to be here and I just have to wait and see what happens.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Anything could be a possibility.Ã‚Â\\xa0 This Draft is tricky and works in a lot of different ways, and I'm just honestly blessed to be here.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 For a lot of players, this is the first job they have ever had.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I was wondering when you were younger, have you ever had another job, and if you did, how much it paid and what it was.  TERRENCE ROSS:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Honestly, this is my first job.Ã‚Â\\xa0 First job.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Since you went to the University of Washington, did you have a chance to go to Vancouver and familiar with Canadian customs?  TERRENCE ROSS:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I think when I was about maybe six, seventh grade, I went up to Vancouver.Ã‚Â\\xa0 It was really nice.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I remember it being really nice and I went to Toronto, even nicer city.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I went there and excited to be there.

Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Thomas, there is a lot of talk that you would be going No.2 to Charlotte.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Is that where you thought you would be going and is this a bit of a surprise?  THOMAS ROBINSON:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I really didn't know where I was going to end up at, but it is a bit of a surprise.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I didn't work out for Sacramento at all.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I probably talked to them about once.  But I'm here, so I'm meant to be here.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Talk about you're such a ferocious rebounder, you and Cousins on the front court, that can really cause problems.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Talk about how you are looking forward to developing with him.  THOMAS ROBINSON:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Well, I can't wait, DeMarcus is similar to me.Ã‚Â\\xa0 He's a tough kid and he's a guard that can play hard, and I'm going to join him.Ã‚Â\\xa0 He put up some numbers last year, but with my help we should be able to get the Kings over the hump.  Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 You're a winner, going to an organization that has not won in a long time and been in the lottery the last six times; what are you going to bring to the Kings in terms of a winning mentality? THOMAS ROBINSON:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Exactly what you just said; my winning mentality.Ã‚Â\\xa0 No matter how old I am, a rookie or not, I'm not letting nobody relax.Ã‚Â\\xa0 It's not cool to lose.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I'm going to go and try and bring that attitude.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 After that second pick, what were the conversations like with you and your agent and the emotions you're feeling now, is that partly because you're ticked off that you were not taken No.2, or the fact that you have just been drafted into the NBA?  THOMAS ROBINSON:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I was just drafted into the NBA (tearing up).  There really was no conversation.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I really didn't have a clue.

AUSTIN RIVERS:Ã‚Â\\xa0 My dad, he was more relaxed.Ã‚Â\\xa0 He just told me to relax, enjoy it, you\\'re going to get picked somewhere.Ã‚Â\\xa0 He told me when I played him, I\\'m not going to score, so that\\'s basically what he told me.Ã‚Â\\xa0 That\\'s it.

Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 With the success of Baylor, and now here you are as a basketball team who changed the culture of the school in terms of that tragic situation of controversy, and you were part of that to bring it back to the map, explain to me what you went through and the decision to go there, and how you moved forward in bringing that glory back to Baylor.  QUINCY MILLER:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Baylor, at first it was a religious school, you know, God always first.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Then I met Coach Drew and Coach Drew is always a very genuine guy and always tells me the truth.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Then I met my teammates after that I and knew I would be able to click with them guys from day one and that's main reason I chose Baylor.  Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Talk about the depth of the Denver Nuggets team and the potential that they have, and also, being able to work under Coach Karl.  QUINCY MILLER:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Coach Karl is a great coach, man, aggressive.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I like his style.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I like the way they play; they play quick, fast, they get shots up and they get to the free throw line and they shoot a lot of 3s.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I don't know that many people who have a memory in this game, but they shoot a lot of 3s.

DAMIAN LILLARD:Ã‚Â\\xa0 First of all, I want to say I'm blessed to be in this position.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I would be lying if I said I expected to be here last year.Ã‚Â\\xa0 But I'm honored, man, just to be drafted that high coming from where I come from, the school that I come from, and just so thankful to be in this situation.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 You're going to a Portland Trail Blazers team that has good talent with (LaMarcus) Aldridge and Nicolas Batum.Ã‚Â\\xa0 How will that help you to accentuate your skill set, especially working with those guys? DAMIAN LILLARD:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I think those guys have been around, they have been in the league.Ã‚Â\\xa0 They will be able to show me the ropes.Ã‚Â\\xa0 They came in young and had to play, and I think that will help me. But as far as being on the course, having a guy like Nicolas Batum on the wing who can shoot the ball and defend very well, and he's an athlete; I think I have those same tools for my position.  And will he Marcus Aldridge, he's an All‑Star, so he demands a double‑team and I can knock down shots, so when teams are double‑teaming him, I'll be the guy that will make them pay for double‑teaming; and if they decide to play him one‑on‑one, then he can make something happen, because that's what he does.  But you know, I feel like I can help their organization.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 You said you would be lying if you said you were expecting to be here a year ago.Ã‚Â\\xa0 What were you expecting a year ago for your future? DAMIAN LILLARD:Ã‚Â\\xa0 My foot was broken and I was just hoping to get this year back.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I got the year back, and I was a junior this year.  I just wanted to come back strong and be better as a player this year and comeback and make a run for the NBA as a senior.Ã‚Â\\xa0 It all fell into place this year, and like I said, I would be lying if I said I expected it to come this fast.  Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 How did you pick Weber State of all places?  DAMIAN LILLARD:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Well, I come from a loyal family, hard‑working family.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Weber State was one of the first schools that recruited me.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I built a relationship with them from day one.Ã‚Â\\xa0 They never tried to blow smoke.Ã‚Â\\xa0 They were honest with me from jump.Ã‚Â\\xa0 They told me if you don't go to class, you're going home; if you don't work hard, you're going home.Ã‚Â\\xa0 And I felt comfortable with the things that they valued, because that's what I was raised in and that's how my family was.  Once I developed that relationship, and we built that strong relationship, I felt like there was no other place that I should go where I would bond with everybody there.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 You're now an NBA guard, the first guard off the board; what does that mean to you? DAMIAN LILLARD:Ã‚Â\\xa0 It means a lot.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Like I said, coming from where I come from, it just shows that I have won people over, and I've always been the underdog, high school, college, being overlooked.  And to finally see that my body of work, how hard I worked to get in this position has paid off and other people see it, it's just a good feeling.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 You mentioned yesterday that you wanted to show teams the past couple of months who you were because of where you went to school; how much do you think these last couple of months have helped you to get to where you are, the No.6 pick in the draft?  DAMIAN LILLARD:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I think it's helped me a lot.Ã‚Â\\xa0 At the end of the season, there was still a lot of questions about me, whether I could do what I do against higher‑level players, and if I was really as good as advertised.Ã‚Â\\xa0 That was one of the main reasons I competed in Chicago both days.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I think competing in Chicago and showing teams that I will go against whoever, and I played well.Ã‚Â\\xa0 So I think that was one of the main things that helped me.Ã‚Â\\xa0 In the workouts I showed that I was in good shape.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I didn't really get tired, I made a lot of shots, and teams also got to see some things I did well that they didn't know I did well.Ã‚Â\\xa0 So I think I helped myself a lot.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 The biggest jump might be on the defensive end, it's really become a point guard's league.Ã‚Â\\xa0 What's it like, you're in a division now with Chris Paul and Stephen Curry; what's it going to be like for you defending these guys, and have you ever gotten a taste of defending anyone at that level? DAMIAN LILLARD:Ã‚Â\\xa0 It's going to be tough, just like it is for every other point guard in the league that's been there.Ã‚Â\\xa0 So it won't be no easier for me, but I defended guys‑‑ Jimmer Fredette, I defended him in college, Nic Wise, Lance Stephenson, he's a point barred, Deron Williams when he was in Utah, caught him in a couple open gyms.  I've got to get better at.Ã‚Â\\xa0 It's something I feel that I have to get better at and keep working, and I've got to want to do it obviously, and I will.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 This is an era of what is considered dominated by NBA point guards.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Do you feel that you can rank right up there with those like a Tony Parker, Deron Williams, as your career progresses?  DAMIAN LILLARD:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I think I can work my way to that point.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I think the type of point guard that I am is becoming the way the if the point guards are in the NBA when you look at Derrick Rose, Russell Westbrook, Tony Parker, you see guys that score the ball really well but they get their teammates involved and they win games most importantly.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I think that's one of the reasons why teams value me, because I can score the ball, I make the right plays and I'm a high‑character guy.  So I think I can eventually work my way into that category.  \"}, 'Meyers Leonard': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=81067', 'text': 'Q.

MEYERS LEONARD:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I didn\\'t have any guarantees.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Just had my fingers crossed coming in.Ã‚Â\\xa0 It\\'s a very exciting time for me and couldn\\'t be happier than to be picked by the Trail Blazers.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Like I said, just going to work as hard as possible and try to prove myself.  Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 How much do you know about the City of Portland?  MEYERS LEONARD:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I haven\\'t really been able to explore the city a lot.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I had dinner there and it was actually good.Ã‚Â\\xa0 And then of course I worked out.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I have heard from numerous people that it is a very nice city to live in.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I know it rains a lot.Ã‚Â\\xa0 But other than that, I can\\'t really say that I have much of a feel for the city in itself.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Talk about the tragedy that you went through with your parents and everything and how that\\'s really propelled you and inspired you to be the best person you can be.  MEYERS LEONARD:Ã‚Â\\xa0 At six years old, I lost my dad.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Obviously a pretty tough time for my family and I.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Grew up with my mom and my brother and I, and not a lot of money sometimes.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Some hardship.Ã‚Â\\xa0 It was tough but it also made me grow into a young man at an earlier age, stepping in and being somewhat of a caretaker throughout my early years of my life and now especially being able to take care of my mom and my family.Ã‚Â\\xa0 It definitely put a good head on my shoulders and just always really willed me to work as hard as possible and have a lot of self‑dedication and desire to make it in life.  '}, 'Jeremy Lamb': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=81068', 'text': \"Q. Ã‚Â\\xa0If you would start with opening remarks about being drafted by the Rockets, please.  JEREMY LAMB:Ã‚Â\\xa0 First of all, I just want to thank God.Ã‚Â\\xa0 During the workout process, I sprained my ankle and God blessed me to come back with a speedy recovery, and be able to work out.  Went up to Houston, really started a relationship with them.Ã‚Â\\xa0 It's a really good program and a good coach, and they seem like they are really in order, and it's a great honor.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 There's good depth on the Rockets' team; talk about how your outside shooting can contribute to that.  JEREMY LAMB:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I think shooting, I can stretch the floor.Ã‚Â\\xa0 You know, I can add scoring, and also on the defensive ends, on the rebound, get deflection and get the break; find a couple of guys that I can look up to; ask questions; learn from them.  So being able to go to a good organization is huge.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 And also, playing under a Hall of Famer like Kevin McHale, how exciting is that? JEREMY LAMB:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Yeah, I've met him plenty of times, and a great guy.Ã‚Â\\xa0 So being able to learn from, like you said, a Hall of Fame coach and just be able to, my first year, be coached by a great coach like that is just‑‑ is a blessing.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 You have got Kevin Martin and Courtney Lee, a lot of guys who play the way you play; are you ready to take some minutes away? JEREMY LAMB:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I am ready to go work hard.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I'm not saying I'm going to go take their minutes, but I'm not going to go and settle.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I'm going to go there and be ready to work hard and do what it takes.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 When you left the meeting with the Rockets yesterday, did you know they were going to pick you and did they tell you they would?Ã‚Â\\xa0 How tough was it, everybody kind of doubting you with the ankle injury and everything, was that tough for you to listen to that for a few days?  JEREMY LAMB:Ã‚Â\\xa0 When I left the meeting, I had no idea.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I thought we did have a good meeting, though.Ã‚Â\\xa0 You know, it was tough with the ankle.Ã‚Â\\xa0 But I think it was almost a good thing, because people try to doubt my heart, doubt my competitiveness, and the whole time I competed when I was working out on a bad ankle. It just showed my competitiveness and that I always want to push myself.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 We saw you in the Green Room kind of sweating and seeing guys going ahead of you, and you're one of the last guys left out there.Ã‚Â\\xa0 What's that like sitting there waiting and seeing other guys go ahead of you?  JEREMY LAMB:Ã‚Â\\xa0 It was tough.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I was just waiting.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I was like, man, you know, I was just waiting.Ã‚Â\\xa0 But you know, you see people go in front of you, and you're happy for them, as well, but as time goes on, it was only the‑‑ it was still in the lottery and I was sweating.Ã‚Â\\xa0 That was just me being anxious and nervous, but once I heard my name called, it was one of the greatest feelings.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I was wondering for a lot of guys, it's the first job they will ever had; have you ever had another job as a youth?Ã‚Â\\xa0 I know your dad is a pastor.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Have you ever been involved with another type of job?Ã‚Â\\xa0 A paying job?  JEREMY LAMB:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Other than like working at camps and stuff like that?Ã‚Â\\xa0 I've worked at camps before.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I've worked at a baseball field doing the concession stands and stuff like that.Ã‚Â\\xa0 But that's about it.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 What baseball field?Ã‚Â\\xa0 How much were you paid?  JEREMY LAMB:Ã‚Â\\xa0 It was a long time ago.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I have no idea what field but‑‑ I don't even remember how much I was getting paid.Ã‚Â\\xa0 But back then I thought it was a lot of money.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I was probably getting paid $5 an hour or something.  Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Doing something like that, how does it form you into the person you are today, when you're about to make way more than $5 a day, how does it shape you as a person?  JEREMY LAMB:Ã‚Â\\xa0 It teaches you discipline, knowing you've got to get there on time.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Once you get a little bit of money, you have to learn to manage your money.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I've always been good with managing my money.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Now that I'm going to get a little more, I have to be disciplined and that played a part in it.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 What did you learn at the University of Connecticut and from Coach Calhoun that you think will serve you best in the NBA?  JEREMY LAMB:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Coach Calhoun was a tough coach to play for, but a great coach to play for.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I was struggling, and Coach always believed in me.Ã‚Â\\xa0 You know, he was always in my head.Ã‚Â\\xa0 He got me mentally tough.Ã‚Â\\xa0 He pushed me to the limit.Ã‚Â\\xa0 When I thought I was working hard, he showed me that I wasn't.Ã‚Â\\xa0 He always told me that I wasn't.  My freshman year, got to play with Kemba Walker, great point guard, and I learned a lot from him.Ã‚Â\\xa0 So my whole time at UConn was a huge learning experience and a time for me to get tougher.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Your competitive nature, is it big to disseminate that against your teammates?Ã‚Â\\xa0 Are you big on having to focus and work hard? JEREMY LAMB:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I'm not the type to go curse my teammates out.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I'm the type to pull them aside and let them know what they are doing.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I'm not the type to get all hyped, but I will tell you and I will try to lead you in that way.  \"}, 'Michael Kidd-Gilchrist': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=81052', 'text': \"Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 If you can start with your opening remarks about your feelings about being drafted No.2.

Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Did you know Kemba Walker at all just from playing in the New York area and what do you think about getting to play with a young point guard like Kemba?

PERRY JONES III:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Well, first let me start off by saying, I mean, I just wanted the opportunity to play in the NBA.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Didn\\'t really matter what pick I got.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Just wanted the chance to play for somebody.  And I\\'m more than happy to play for Oklahoma City and Kevin Durant, somebody I look at on film.Ã‚Â\\xa0 He\\'s my favorite player.Ã‚Â\\xa0 So therefore, for me to be under his wing is going to be wonders for me.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 How are you able to establish what type of player you are?Ã‚Â\\xa0 Are you going to be a back‑to‑the‑basket player or more on the wing?Ã‚Â\\xa0 How are you looking to establish your identity?  PERRY JONES III:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Well, just starting off just playing basketball, whatever the coach feels he needs me to play or wherever he\\'s more comfortable with me playing, that\\'s where I need to be, but that\\'s all Coach\\'s decision.  Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Did you watch the Finals?Ã‚Â\\xa0 What did you think of them?  PERRY JONES III:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I wanted a Game 7 to be honest.Ã‚Â\\xa0 But I mean, I was rooting for Oklahoma Cityso it did put a smile on my face.  Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 What do you think of the idea of playing with Durant and playing with Russell Westbrook?  PERRY JONES III:Ã‚Â\\xa0 They are going to teach me a lot.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I\\'m just going to be under their wing.Ã‚Â\\xa0 They can make me a better player, and those guys work hard, so being with somebody that works hard, and Durant is just amazing.Ã‚Â\\xa0 So definitely be under his wing and learning from him is going to help my game.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Talk about how the Baylor basketball program has really flourished over the past few years and talk about how special that\\'s been for you?  PERRY JONES III:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I think we\\'ve come a long way, because a lot of guys made sacrifices:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Me, Quincy Miller, Quincy Acy, a lot of guys made a lot of sacrifices, giving up chances to score for other people, being very unselfish.Ã‚Â\\xa0 That\\'s the big reason why Baylor is coming up, because of the unselfishness of the players.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I guess obviously going into the Draft, you were seen by many as a potential sort of top pick.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Falling to where you did, was it tough sitting there, and do you think you\\'ll use this as motivation moving forward? PERRY JONES III:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Definitely used it as motivation.Ã‚Â\\xa0 But once again, I just wanted the opportunity to play anywhere, no matter if I got picked next round.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Whichever team I\\'m going to, I\\'m just happy, because that\\'s the team that I actually like and enjoy watching.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I know those guys are going to help me as a player and as a person.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 So you\\'re glad that things worked out the way they did, especially where you ended up?  PERRY JONES III:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I actually am.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I actually am.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 There is like a side to you that says, \"Oh, my God, I slipped, this is terrible\"; but there\\'s the other side that says, \"I\\'m with a team that can compete for a championship.\"Ã‚Â\\xa0 Is that the other side of the slide, that you get the opportunity to immediately go to a winner?  PERRY JONES III:Ã‚Â\\xa0 That\\'s a good question.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I mean, it wouldn\\'t matter to me if they were a contender or not.Ã‚Â\\xa0 They are somebody I could see myself playing with.Ã‚Â\\xa0 They like to run the floor real well, and they are one of the best teams, and I know I can learn from them.Ã‚Â\\xa0 What\\'s better than learning from one of the best teams?Ã‚Â\\xa0 They were in the Finals.Ã‚Â\\xa0 They have great players, great coach.Ã‚Â\\xa0 This is just an opportunity for me to grow.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 How is it coming from a school where you\\'ve got one segment, you have (Brittney) Griner who won a title and that segment of the school, and you have another segment that\\'s growing with a quarterfinal and that has a Heisman Trophy winner and then you revitalized a program that went down with scandal you and brought legitimacy back to the program?Ã‚Â\\xa0 How is it living with that triangle of stars and getting along with each other and all of that? PERRY JONES III:Ã‚Â\\xa0 It wasn\\'t difficult.Ã‚Â\\xa0 We knew each other before all of the good things started happening.Ã‚Â\\xa0 So it was just real easy to get accustomed to each other when the limelight hit us.

BERNARD JAMES:Ã‚Â\\xa0 You just saw, the whole pre‑Draft process, I really enjoyed it, just traveling, meeting players that I have not played against in college; meeting the staff for a lot of these teams.  You know, I didn't have the opportunity to work out for Dallas, but I know a lot about their program.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I know a lot about their team.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I've been to Dallas plenty of times.Ã‚Â\\xa0 It's a great community, great city, a great team.Ã‚Â\\xa0 So I'm really happy to be going there and can't wait to get started.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Talk about what Coach Ham, his pro experience as a coach, and what advice he gave you to be able to get ready for the next level.  BERNARD JAMES:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I mean, just he tells us stories about his experience as a pro coach all the time.Ã‚Â\\xa0 He says he likes college a lot better, coaching college guys.  But, you know, did he stress how important attitude and work ethic are.Ã‚Â\\xa0 That can make up for a lot of lack in the skill department if you just work hard every day and improve.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Talk about your journey, you're going to be an older rookie.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Talk about your journey.  BERNARD JAMES:Ã‚Â\\xa0 It has been a journey, man.Ã‚Â\\xa0 You know, six years in the military; CCC, two years in junior college and two years at Florida State.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I've improved so much in basketball, just from my first day playing in the military to now, which is a ten‑year process.  I still have a lot more to learn.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I'm nowhere near my ceiling, and I think Dallas, you'll see me improve a lot there and I'll be able to contribute.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Being older and experienced, what does it mean to be a polished person, as well as a high‑character person; did your parents instill it into you or coaches or your high school former athletic director?Ã‚Â\\xa0 How do you see the benefit walking in at 27?  BERNARD JAMES:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I mean, the benefits are exactly what you said.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Just high character.Ã‚Â\\xa0 You know, having that life experience, it makes me think a better teammate than most.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I've experienced things that a lot of these guys haven't and can't relate to, and I think I'll be able to bring that to a team and just kind of help keep the team grounded and focused on what's important.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I know a lot of people are focused on one day being in that Green Room and making it happen.Ã‚Â\\xa0 But what's the experience coming here, sitting in the audience, going in the second round, but the benefits of just being here and being a part of it still.  BERNARD JAMES:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Yeah, I'm not the type of guy to have an ego or anything, so I just appreciate the opportunity.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I've worked hard to get here, and I'm going to do my best to make Dallas proud to have me.Ã‚Â\\xa0 You know, I feel like Green Room or not, you're still going to have to earn your keep.Ã‚Â\\xa0 So going into the second round, going into the first round, it's not much of a difference to me.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I'm still going to have to go there and work hard every day just like the rest of these guys.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Talk about, you came from a defensive system in Florida State, and now that can help you with Dallas, especially working with a defensive coach like Rick Carlisle.  BERNARD JAMES:Ã‚Â\\xa0 It's going to be huge.Ã‚Â\\xa0 We have played so many different defensive schemes at Florida State.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Every workout I've been to, I've been able to‑‑ I've had experience with what they wanted me to do.Ã‚Â\\xa0 So I'm going to step into Dallas and I have already had experience with what they are doing no matter what.  I think I'll be able to pick it up quick and really, really get fine tuned into their defense.Ã‚Â\\xa0 You know, whatever I can contribute on offense is a plus.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I know a lot of times we sit back with all of this great opportunity; we think of cars, we think of houses, but have you thought about a charitable event or a foundation or something that you want to give back?  BERNARD JAMES:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I'm definitely going to do something in relation to veterans.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I am a veteran and I've been in school.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I know it's tough sometimes.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Whatever I do, I'm definitely going to help the veterans out.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Men and women, fighting for our country holds a special place in my heart.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I've done it myself and I just want to help out my brothers and sisters. \"}, 'John Henson': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=81064', 'text': \"Q.

Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Scott Skiles preaches defense and you're arguably the best defensive player in the Draft.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Talk about how that can get you minutes?  JOHN HENSON:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Yeah, you want to find ways to get on the court, whether you're defense, shot‑blocker, I think if I'm preaching defense, I'm in good hands.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I'm excited to get this started and get to Milwaukee.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Skiles is a guy that is compared to a college coach in that he plays the hot hand and doesn't give consistent roles.Ã‚Â\\xa0 You're used to playing for a big‑time college system.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Does that help you adjust?  JOHN HENSON:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Yeah, I think it will.Ã‚Â\\xa0 You know, he wants to win, and whatever a coach has to do to win is necessary, and the way he coaches, like you said, I think it's a good philosophy; a hot hand, the person is going to contribute and hopefully I can be one of those guys.

Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Kendall changed his cell phone number yesterday so he would not get all of the calls from everybody today.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Did you do the same thing?

Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Did you know anything about where you were going?Ã‚Â\\xa0 Were you surprised to still there be at 14?  JOHN HENSON:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I wasn't surprised.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Milwaukee told me that if Drummond dropped they would take him but if not they would take me.Ã‚Â\\xa0 But Milwaukee, glad they picked me and it's a great fit.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 You're going to be working with a dynamic backcourt with Brandon Jennings and Monta Ellis; talk about how that will get you open looks? JOHN HENSON:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Obviously I'll be there to make the open shot.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Scoring is something that's probably not going to be a necessity on that team with those two guys.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Can you talk about how it might have felt for your teammate Tyler Zeller to be the last player in the Green Room?  JOHN HENSON:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I don't know.Ã‚Â\\xa0 You know, he got picked by Dallas, a great organization, a bunch of USC guys, so it's not a bad place to fall, Dallas, with that type of atmosphere and I'm excited for him.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 You seem to have a beautiful family, great relationship; what role will they play with you in Milwaukee?  JOHN HENSON:Ã‚Â\\xa0 They are going to come out with me.Ã‚Â\\xa0 We are going to figure out a car, you know, get a car, place to live, things of that nature and just ready to get to work.Ã‚Â\\xa0 This is a great process and in about two weeks I think we are going out to Vegas, so got to get ready for that.  \"}, 'Moe Harkless': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=81060', 'text': \"Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Your thoughts on being drafted by Philadelphia?

MOE HARKLESS:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Man, I worked really hard.Ã‚Â\\xa0 It's the hardest I've worked in my life, and I didn't think I could work as hard as I've been working.Ã‚Â\\xa0 It's definitely a great feeling and I'm happy to be here.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I'm blessed.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Your mom must have been pretty excited about Philadelphia since it's only 90 miles away.Ã‚Â\\xa0 She must have been ecstatic.  MOE HARKLESS:Ã‚Â\\xa0 She's excited about just being here.Ã‚Â\\xa0 The team didn't matter; she was really emotional and she's probably out there still crying.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I'm definitely glad I could make her happy and make my dreams come true.  Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Since it's only 90 miles from St. John's, is she going to make you finish your degree?  MOE HARKLESS:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Oh, yeah, I'm going to finish school.  Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Did you work out with the 76ers and were you surprised when your name was called by them? MOE HARKLESS:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Yeah, I did work out with the 76ers.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Not really, because talking to the organization, they told me they really liked me and that there was a really high chance that they would pick me.Ã‚Â\\xa0 So it was definitely a great feeling, and I kind of had a gut feeling.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 You're the first guy we've seen at the podium who was not a Green Room invite.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Talk about that experience, watching other guys down there together and shaking hands and you being away from that.  MOE HARKLESS:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Watching those guys, I'm definitely happy for those guys because a lot of those guys I know.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Whether I was in the Green Room or not, it didn't really matter.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Just grateful to have my name called and be given this opportunity.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 What part of your game do you still have to work on in the off‑season to better prepare you for the pro game? MOE HARKLESS:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I think the main thing is just getting stronger.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I think that's really what's going to take my game to the next level.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 What was it about Philadelphia that you had a gut feeling?Ã‚Â\\xa0 What happened between you guys that gave you that feeling? MOE HARKLESS:Ã‚Â\\xa0 You know, the workout went really well.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I did well in the workout, and also afterwards when I was talking to the GM and the coach, it felt really comfortable.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I felt like they would genuinely like me and that there was a high chance that they would pick me.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Do you like playing in that arena?Ã‚Â\\xa0 How do you feel about that?  MOE HARKLESS:Ã‚Â\\xa0 It's a nice place to play.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I can't wait to actually get down there.  Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Talk about what St. John's was able to do for you.  MOE HARKLESS:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Kind of just being there humbled me a lot.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I was very humble but being there and working with Coach Rico and Coach Dunlap who is now the coach of Bobcats, they taught me how to work hard and dedicate myself to the game; I think they helped me a lot with the little things.  Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Were you surprised that you were not invited to the Green Room?  MOE HARKLESS:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I mean, I felt that I should have been invited to the Green Room, but like I said, it really didn't matter to me because I'm just blessed to be here.  \"}, 'Evan Fournier': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=81066', 'text': \"Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 If you would give us remarks about being drafted by Denver.

Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Wanted to ask you, Denver has a lot of young talent, a lot of depth.Ã‚Â\\xa0 How are you looking forward to the challenge of being able to carve out some minutes for yourself?  EVAN FOURNIER:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I'm just going to work hard.Ã‚Â\\xa0 That's the only way.  But, you know, I think Denver is good for me, because the way they play, they run the floor a lot, and that's what I like.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 What about your game is a strength for American fans to see?  EVAN FOURNIER:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I'm a slasher.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I'm a kind of Ginobili.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I can charge to the basket and finish around the rim.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I think that's my biggest strength.

ANDRÃƒâ€° DRUMMOND:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Speechless, really.Ã‚Â\\xa0 It's a great opportunity for me.Ã‚Â\\xa0 It's a dream come true, growing up as a little kid hearing my name being called and shaking David Stern's hand.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I just feel great.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Talk about how you're looking forward to play with good, young players like Brandon Knight and how you'll grow together?  ANDRÃƒâ€° DRUMMOND:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I know we'll build a great team chemistry right away.Ã‚Â\\xa0 It's a great organization and the fans are great up there.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I just can't wait to be a part of the team.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Do you see yourself as the center on the team or is Greg Monroe the center?  ANDRÃƒâ€° DRUMMOND:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I see myself wherever coach puts me is wherever I'm going to work my hardest at.  Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Not sure how much you even paid attention to all of the talk this week or what your agent was telling you all week.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Is this now just a sense of relief and pretty emotional?  ANDRÃƒâ€° DRUMMOND:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Yeah, I mean, I talked to Detroit; I actually worked out with them the day before the Draft actually and they told me they liked me a lot and if I was still there, they would definitely take me.Ã‚Â\\xa0 The 8th pick went by and they were right up, and I just broke down in tears because I knew I was going to get called next.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 You said Detroit worked you out the day before and others have said the teams didn't work them out at all.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Is there any rhyme or reason on this?Ã‚Â\\xa0 Trying to figure out if the workouts mean anything? ANDRÃƒâ€° DRUMMOND:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Every work out means everything because you need to go out there and showcase yourself to a team.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Sometimes you might not be a position they are looking for but it's always good to take a look at you.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Every workout means something to me and I'm sure it means a lot to every other player that went to workouts, as well.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Talk about what's the one thing you feel that you have to address quickly as you arrive in the NBA?  ANDRÃƒâ€° DRUMMOND:Ã‚Â\\xa0 With the help of my teammates, lift the organization and the family out there; all the talk about my not playing hard is going to be put to rest immediately.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I'll have my teammates who are my brothers now to push me and I'll put that to rest and the rest of the game is going to be great because they have a great coaching staff out there, as well‑‑ he's going to help me rebound; rebound, box out.  Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 How long do you think you need to make an impact in the NBA?Ã‚Â\\xa0 You're young, obviously, do we have to be patient with you a little bit? ANDRÃƒâ€° DRUMMOND:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I think I'm not going to try to force anything too fast.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Just do whatever Coach tells me to do and wherever he puts me is where I'm going to play and I'm going to work my hardest and I'm going to give it my all every single day.  I think when I do come in, I can definitely make an impact on defense, run the floor really well and grab rebounds and block shots.  Offensively is what they are going to work on me with, and it's definitely going to come to me.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 You were very emotional on the stage; what was going through your mind at that point?  ANDRÃƒâ€° DRUMMOND:Ã‚Â\\xa0 It's just a sign of relief.Ã‚Â\\xa0 My mom was holding my hand throughout the whole Draft and she was like, we're here, be patient, your name is going to be called soon.Ã‚Â\\xa0 As soon as Toronto went by and Detroit came up, I started breaking down because I thought about all of the years I worked hard and all of the struggles I went through playing basketball; just everything I went through, and just being here today, hearing my name being called is the greatest thing in the world.  Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Did you expect to go sooner?  ANDRÃƒâ€° DRUMMOND:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I didn't look at myself as being a top pick or anything like that.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I just looked at it wherever I was going to go I was going to work my hardest, doesn't matter wherever you go, one, two, three, four, five on the list; whenever I go, I'm going to work my hardest.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 On a lighter note, are you looking forward to competing in the Dunk Contest?

Ã‚Â\\xa0If you could start with an opening remark about your career and skills and such.  ANTHONY DAVIS:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Yeah, undescribable right now.Ã‚Â\\xa0 A great feeling, great experience, I\\'ve wanted this all my life, so it\\'s finally here.Ã‚Â\\xa0 To be drafted No.1 overall meanings a lot to me, for a 19‑year‑old freshman, now professional.Ã‚Â\\xa0 The City of New Orleans was great, I had a great time when I went to visit.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I just can\\'t wait to get down there and start to play.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Congratulations on being the No.1 draft pick.Ã‚Â\\xa0 What do you think your biggest adjustment is going to be going from the college game to the pro game?  ANTHONY DAVIS:Ã‚Â\\xa0 The physicality.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Guys are a lot stronger in the NBA and I know that\\'s one of my weaknesses, so I try to make it a strength, stay in the weight room, try to get tougher.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Talk about how your defensive intensity and skill set will really help this team win games quickly?  ANTHONY DAVIS:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Yeah, I just have to come in and play defense.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I know they are a defensive‑oriented team and I love to play defense, and that\\'s what the coaches stress a lot.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I think my defensive ability, I think we can do a great job with defending guys.Ã‚Â\\xa0 At the same time, still got to put points on the board so make sure we work hard every day, stay in the gym and just keep working.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Anthony, how important is it for the Hornets to retain Eric Gordon, and will you play a part in convincing him to stay in New Orleans? ANTHONY DAVIS: Ã‚Â\\xa0I\\'m not sure a rookie can do that.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I don\\'t think I have that much power.  But he\\'s a great player.Ã‚Â\\xa0 They told me he\\'s one of the best players off the dribble.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Very guardable off the dribble, great shooter, very athletic.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Great to play alongside him in the Hornets and I hope he stays.  Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Talk about the business side of this, how difficult was it selecting an agent, how about sifting through endorsement offers and how has that process been? ANTHONY DAVIS:Ã‚Â\\xa0 It\\'s been going well so far.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I wanted to choose an agent who was family and who I trusted and they won\\'t take advantage of me.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I thought Washington Media Group was the best decision for me.  As far as endorsements, still working on the endorsements and still working on the shoe contract but I think everything will fall into place.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Is \"the brow\" going to be part of that endorsement?  ANTHONY DAVIS:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Most definitely.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Unless I cut it off.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 In the one‑and‑done era, a lot of guys are the pre‑ordained picks coming out of high school and college is almost a filler; how have you changed in the last year as a player and how did your year at Kentucky affect you?  ANTHONY DAVIS:Ã‚Â\\xa0 As far as a player, I think I changed a lot.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I think I became more of a leader, more mature, developed a post game I didn\\'t have going into Kentucky.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Kentucky really helped me a lot.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Coach Cal is a great coach.Ã‚Â\\xa0 He coached in the pros before, so it helped me, as well, to become pro‑ready.Ã‚Â\\xa0 He runs his practices in the program as a pro team, and I think me going to Kentucky really helped me become prepared.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Now that the moment got here and it really happened, can you describe and take us through it, comparing it to how the dream might have been?  ANTHONY DAVIS:Ã‚Â\\xa0 The dream, you just sit there at night, just thinking about it, waiting for the day to come, when it will actually happen.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I told myself I wasn\\'t going to be nervous, just going to relax when I was at that table; David Stern said, \"New Orleans is on the clock, five minutes,\" and I started shaking.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Just hit me right then and there.Ã‚Â\\xa0 My arm was shaking and my hands were sweaty.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Got up and hugged Michael, my best friend, wanted to hug him for a minute.Ã‚Â\\xa0 One of my best friends, when my name got called, wanted to make sure he stayed close.Ã‚Â\\xa0 The reality of it hit.  Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Just your reaction to being from the first school that ever got the first two picks in any NBA Draft?  ANTHONY DAVIS:Ã‚Â\\xa0 It\\'s crazy.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Michael is a great player.Ã‚Â\\xa0 We have two down and four more to go.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Hopefully all of them will go in the first round.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 What was your day like, even though this was expected; were you a bundle of nerves all day or pretty calm? ANTHONY DAVIS:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Oh, yeah, I tried to sleep.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Couldn\\'t sleep.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Couldn\\'t eat lunch.Ã‚Â\\xa0 We had lunch with the Commissioner.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Couldn\\'t eat lunch.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I was just anxious.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Just ready, I kept looking at my suit, putting it on, had it on one time before that and took it back off.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Just ready for the day.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Now it\\'s finally here and it finally happened.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 What did new owner Tom Benson have to say to you leading up to the Draft and your big day?  ANTHONY DAVIS:Ã‚Â\\xa0 He didn\\'t say much.Ã‚Â\\xa0 He told me about the new practice facility; New Orleans is a great city and trying to get it back on the map after everything that happened there.Ã‚Â\\xa0 He said he would love to have me there.Ã‚Â\\xa0 That\\'s what really made me nervous.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 What did your new coach have to say?  ANTHONY DAVIS:Ã‚Â\\xa0 He\\'s very excited.Ã‚Â\\xa0 He\\'s excited about the team, ready to get back in the gym.Ã‚Â\\xa0 He loves basketball.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Great guy.Ã‚Â\\xa0 He\\'s a great guy, great Christian guy, and I think he can take us a long way.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Isiah and Hardaway and Dwyane Wade, seems like all of these great players from Chicago; what\\'s your thought on it? ANTHONY DAVIS:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Chicago has great basketball players.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I think it\\'s one of the top two cities for basketball.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Just go out there and work hard.Ã‚Â\\xa0 The city has done well in the NBA and I just have to keep the legacy going.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Do you see yourself as the kind of person who would enjoy the spotlight, doing the commercials and endorsements?Ã‚Â\\xa0 Is that something that\\'s comfortable or you\\'ll need to learn a little bit?  ANTHONY DAVIS:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Pretty comfortable.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Like I said, at Kentucky we had it all the time, especially the six who played, we had the spotlight all the time.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I think it really prepared me.Ã‚Â\\xa0 But I know the NBA is a whole different level, new world and I think I\\'m pretty prepared for it.  Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Will you also talk about the eyebrows and the decision?  ANTHONY DAVIS:Ã‚Â\\xa0 My parents and agent came to me with the idea about the trademark and I thought it was a great idea.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Seems there\\'s no point of the other guys making money off what\\'s yours, so I thought it would be a great idea and we decided to go through with it.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 What part of your game do you think you\\'ll be able to showcase in the NBA that you didn\\'t have the opportunity to showcase at Kentucky with so much talent there?  ANTHONY DAVIS:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I\\'m not sure what my coach needs me to do.Ã‚Â\\xa0 He might want me to play like the way I played at Kentucky, I\\'m not sure.Ã‚Â\\xa0 If he wants me to do something different, or if I have any weaknesses, make it my strength.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I\\'m ready to just go there and have fun.  '}, 'Bradley Beal': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=81059', 'text': \"Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Start with your thoughts about being drafted by the Wizards?  BRADLEY BEAL:Ã‚Â\\xa0 First of all it's a blessing and an honor to be drafted and to be drafted by the Wizards is terrific.Ã‚Â\\xa0 They have a great front office and great team on the uprising.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Looking forward to making an impact and going to D.C..   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Now they have acquired Trevor Ariza as well as Emeka Okafor, and they already have Nene.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Talk about how that veteran leadership can really accentuate your game.  BRADLEY BEAL:Ã‚Â\\xa0 It really can like you just said.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Hopefully I can look up to these guys and they can take me under their wing and push me to be better and help the team out as much as I can.Ã‚Â\\xa0 We have two great bigs and a big point guard who can continue to get better and Ariza has proved himself that he can win games.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Hopefully I can just get to D.C. and make an impact as quickly as I can.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Other teams have talked about wanting to trade up; what's that like for you and is Washington the team you thought was the best fit for you?  BRADLEY BEAL:Ã‚Â\\xa0 First, I thought any fit would have been pretty good but that fit kind of made more sense than anything.Ã‚Â\\xa0 But the trade speculations really made me nervous because I had no idea where I was going to go.Ã‚Â\\xa0 At first I thought it was between Charlotte, Cleveland and then Washington but then all of a sudden you hear all of these other teams want to trade up and get other players, as well.Ã‚Â\\xa0 So you never knew what was going to happen but at the end of the day, I was glad I was picked third.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I know you battled with the decision to come out from Florida, but now that you're here, pretty good decision, right?  BRADLEY BEAL:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Yeah, it was a great decision I would say.Ã‚Â\\xa0 But it was pretty tough honestly, because I like school, and what I wanted to do in school required at least 12 years worth of school.Ã‚Â\\xa0 So to give it up for something totally new, and then our team next year would have been great, and I still hope they will be great and I hope for nothing but the best for them.Ã‚Â\\xa0 But at the end of the day, I knew I had to chase this dream in front of me.  Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 How did you celebrate your 18th birthday and how is this different?  BRADLEY BEAL:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I was at school my 18th birthday so it wasn't too good, summer school.Ã‚Â\\xa0 We have orientation, so it wasn't too good of a birthday.Ã‚Â\\xa0 But this one definitely tops off anything else.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 And also do you see yourself as a starter right away? BRADLEY BEAL:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Whatever Coach wants me to do and whatever role he puts me in, I'm willing to do whatever it takes to win and to help the team.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I'm not going to come in and just try to force the issue.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I'm going to try to come in and try to feel things out and get to know the vets a little bit and get them to push me and actually start learning the game more, and hopefully if I'm in that role, I'm in that role.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 What's the one aspect of your game, obviously the Wizards touted your shooting ability and speed; but what's the one aspect of your game that you think you can bring to the Washington Wizards to impact the team immediately going into next season? BRADLEY BEAL:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Hopefully my shooting ability and my ability to space the floor out.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Hopefully that gives driving lanes for John Wall and Jordan Crawford.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Hopefully I can make shots when I'm open.  Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Have you stopped and reflected on what type of community service or foundation you're going to start or one of the first things that you're going to do to help other people? BRADLEY BEAL:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I'm big on that and that's one of the first things I want to do outside of basketball is get back to the community, whether it's visiting kids in hospital or teaching them basketball.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I love to do little things like that, because they support you, and it's always great and I think you should support them as well.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I'm really big on that and hopefully I can get started right away.  Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Have you been in touch with David Lee and has he advised you on transitioning to the next level? BRADLEY BEAL:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I haven't really talked to him much during the process, but when I have, he said it's another level and that you have to be ready to step up and make an impact and that they are making an investment in you, so you really want to give it your all.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I've been talking to people and I want to make sure I do the right things.  \"}, 'Harrison Barnes': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=81055', 'text': \"Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Harrison, if you can start with opening comments about being drafted by the Warriors.

Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Talk about how you're looking forward to working under Mark Jackson and learning the tricks of the trade?  HARRISON BARNES:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Yeah, I always had a lot of respect for him when he was an analyst, especially as a player, as well.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I got a chance to talk with him at Chicago a little bit, just talking basketball.Ã‚Â\\xa0 And it was great to see how much of a player's coach he is.Ã‚Â\\xa0 So I'm definitely looking forward to being coached underneath him and having that relationship.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Could you just talk about being able now to play with Andrew Bogut and what you expect to bring to his game?  HARRISON BARNES:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Hopefully add three‑point shooting and a little diversity.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I'm bigger than Klay but Klay and Stephen (Curry) can both shoot the ball, so I just want to do whatever the team needs me to do.

HARRISON BARNES:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I haven't.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Actually I have a few friends that have been in that area and they told me it's beautiful.Ã‚Â\\xa0 So I definitely look forward to going out there tomorrow.

HARRISON BARNES:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Everyone is different.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Me personally, I'm just truly blessed to be in this position.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Looking back over my high school years and middle school years and stuff like that, there was a chance I wasn't going to be this player.Ã‚Â\\xa0 So I'm just happy to be here and I'm just going to try to‑‑ whatever my ceiling is, I'm definitely going to try to reach it.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 When you saw all of the names ahead of you, is that motivation for you going forward?Ã‚Â\\xa0 Is that something you're going to use as maybe a chip?  HARRISON BARNES:Ã‚Â\\xa0 That will always be motivation.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Just the fact that, you know, someone says they are better than you and they are drafted higher than you, so that's always going to be motivation.Ã‚Â\\xa0 So I'm extremely happy that the Warriors were able to pick me and I can't wait to get out there.  \"}, 'Quincy Acy': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=81071', 'text': \"Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Your thoughts on being drafted by Toronto?

QUINCY ACY:Ã‚Â\\xa0 His uncle is part of the team and just great connections there.Ã‚Â\\xa0 When we got a chance to go out there this past summer, I got a good chance to look at the city.

QUINCY ACY:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Competitiveness and toughness.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I mean, I can be an exciting force off the bench; compete, be willing to do all the dirty work and help my team put themselves in a position to win games.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Tell me about your growth and development, you go to Baylor, kind of like an obscure school, and then all of a sudden you get the big‑time star in girls basketball and then you get the Heisman Trophy winner and then there's the basketball team that has some serious controversial issues but then you were part of the group that brought that back.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Tell me what that means to you.

So yeah, definitely, with the time that I have outside of basketball, I'm going to definitely do my job of giving back to the community.  \"}}, 2013: {'Cody Zeller': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=90516', 'text': \"Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Cody, we talked before and you said you don't think you're going to be around in the end of the lottery.Ã‚Â\\xa0 How soon did you know you were going to Charlotte?  CODY ZELLER:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I was just kidding my agent because he didn't bail me out.Ã‚Â\\xa0 He didn't tell me.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I didn't know until David Stern announced it.Ã‚Â\\xa0 It's a crazy process not knowing, but I'm definitely excited that I ended up with the Bobcats.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Cody, I wanted to ask you about, Charlotte hasn't been the most stable organization in the past few years.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Talk about going into that organization.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Do you feel there's extra pressure, putting pressure on yourself and your teammates to be able to try to turn it around as quickly as possible?  CODY ZELLER:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I've always dealt with pressure growing up with two older brothers through high school, through college.Ã‚Â\\xa0 So I don't think that will affect me too much.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I'm ready to go in there to work and make a difference.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Bringing my work ethic every day and see where it takes me.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Were you a Michael Jordan fan growing up?Ã‚Â\\xa0 And have you talked to him at all during this whole process?  CODY ZELLER:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Yeah, a huge fan obviously.Ã‚Â\\xa0 One of the,Ã‚Â\\xa0 if not the, best player to ever play the game.Ã‚Â\\xa0 It is unbelievable.Ã‚Â\\xa0 It's unbelievable I'll be able to talk with him and learn from him.Ã‚Â\\xa0 It will be an unbelievable experience for me.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Cody, the Charlotte Bobcats really don't have that franchise guy.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Can you be that franchise guy?  CODY ZELLER:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I'm not worried about the title of franchise guy or anything.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I'm going to come in and try to be the hardest‑working guy, is what I'm going to try to be.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Hopefully the other guys there will follow my lead or I'll join them, if it's a good group of hard‑working guys, then the team is going to start winning.

OTTO PORTER, JR.:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I feel like I can come in and give a lot of energy right off the bat.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Give them that lift that they need, be that glue guy that brings the team together.Ã‚Â\\xa0 And come to work hard and have a winning mentality the whole time.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Otto, we talked in the elevator about this, this is probably the least stressful of all the picks.Ã‚Â\\xa0 How much Washington Wizards basketball have you watched?Ã‚Â\\xa0 And talk about the idea of playing with John Wall and Bradley Beal.  OTTO PORTER, JR.:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I watched quite a few.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I played there.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I catch a few games every now and then when I'm not playing, and everything like that.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Just to see where I can fit in and help with John Wall and Beal and the rest of the guys, and see that they really need help in my position.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Everything was saying you were one of the guys most NBA‑ready coming into this draft.Ã‚Â\\xa0 What are your thoughts about that?Ã‚Â\\xa0 And what are realistic expectations in your rookie season?  OTTO PORTER, JR.:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I feel like I am 100% ready.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I feel like my game can transpire to the next level a lot easier as the rest of them because I'm very versatile.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I can do many things on the court offensively and defensively.Ã‚Â\\xa0 And just to bring it to the next level, the transition, it's still going to be tough.Ã‚Â\\xa0 But I think it's going to be the best transition.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Otto, congratulations.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Getting to the next level you mentioned that you think your game can transition.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Where do you think you excel the most at?Ã‚Â\\xa0 And where can you contribute immediately?  OTTO PORTER, JR.:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I feel like I can contribute on the defensive side immediately, being that next guy to rotate around, that next guy to defend and get rebounds to lead to our offense and open up the court.  So I think I can definitely bring that immediately.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Otto, I know you said your dad was your favorite player.Ã‚Â\\xa0 What was it like to share that with him and have your family here to experience this?  OTTO PORTER, JR.:Ã‚Â\\xa0 It was amazing to see the smile on his face, and my mom's face.Ã‚Â\\xa0 All the hard work they put into me in raising me the right way, it's finally paid off for them.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Otto, you didn't take the AAU route like a lot of guys in this draft and a lot of drafts.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Can you talk about what led you to make that decision?  OTTO PORTER, JR.:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I think just wanting to be good.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Wanting to do something with basketball.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I felt like in the summertime while I travel all over the place, to play a couple of games, why not just stay home and work on your game yourself?Ã‚Â\\xa0 You know you're doing something every day to get you better.  So I feel like that was the best way to do it, and it paid off.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Otto, you come from a rich basketball tradition at Georgetown and there have been so many graduates that have gone on to have tremendous careers.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Have you been in touch with those graduates?Ã‚Â\\xa0 And what advice have they given you?  OTTO PORTER, JR.:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Definitely, definitely.Ã‚Â\\xa0 From all the recent NBA picks from Georgetown, Jeff Green, Roy Hibbert, and Greg Monroe.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I talked to them guys a lot during this process, and they're the ones that told me the in and outs of what to expect from the NBA and how the transition was going to go.  But at the end of the day they told me just enjoy.Ã‚Â\\xa0 This is a once‑in‑a‑lifetime process and to enjoy.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Otto, obviously you're a fine player.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Do you think Monumental Sports made a decision to draft you to sell some tickets in the Verizon Center?Ã‚Â\\xa0 And you'll be able to finish up your college education since you'll be playing in the same town.  OTTO PORTER, JR.:Ã‚Â\\xa0 That's on my part.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I think they really brought me there to help the organization win.Ã‚Â\\xa0 And that's what I'm going to do when I go there.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 What about are you going to work on your degree while you're playing down there?  OTTO PORTER, JR.:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Definitely.

MASON PLUMLEE:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I sure couldn't.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I mean, I'm so excited looking forward to summer league, camp, all that.Ã‚Â\\xa0 It's coming at me real fast.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I'm just excited about it.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Mason, I know you didn't work out for the Nets.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Was there a range you were expecting to get drafted in?Ã‚Â\\xa0 And how has the night been for you overall?  MASON PLUMLEE:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Based on my workouts, I figured I would go somewhere between 10 and 20.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Those are the teams that I worked out for.Ã‚Â\\xa0 But I'm just as happy here as I would have been in any of those places.  I'm ready to play some basketball.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Did you start getting nervous as things went along?  MASON PLUMLEE:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Yeah, I mean, nervous, just anxious.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Whatever.Ã‚Â\\xa0 A lot of emotions.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I couldn't be happier with the result.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Do you think you could take Coach Kidd on one‑on‑one?  MASON PLUMLEE:Ã‚Â\\xa0 That's my coach (laughing).Ã‚Â\\xa0 I don't want to speak on that right away.Ã‚Â\\xa0 No, he's a hell of a player.Ã‚Â\\xa0 If I can hang with him, I'll be all right.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Mason, talk about how your experience with such a rich program and also how your experience in college basketball can help you be able to be ready to play at this level immediately.  MASON PLUMLEE:Ã‚Â\\xa0 One thing I've always been proud of as a player is coming from‑‑ in high school I was part of a winning program.Ã‚Â\\xa0 And then in college I was part of a winning program.Ã‚Â\\xa0 That doesn't mean we always won championships, but more often than not there's a standard of winning, of excellence, whatever you call it.  You leave those places with certain things.Ã‚Â\\xa0 So I feel I've been a fit for both of those situations.Ã‚Â\\xa0 My high school coach, coach David Gaines and my college coach Mike Krzyzewski.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 You played for Coach Krzyzewski, as did your new general manager Billy King‑‑ MASON PLUMLEE:Ã‚Â\\xa0 As did Jason Kidd.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Have you talked with any of those guys or Coach K about how that play may out?  MASON PLUMLEE:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I interviewed with the Nets at the combine in Chicago.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I've seen Billy a couple of times down on campus.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Never talked to Jason Kidd.Ã‚Â\\xa0 So...   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Just describe your game overall.Ã‚Â\\xa0 What do you think you have to work on to become the player you want to be in the NBA?Ã‚Â\\xa0 And what do you feel are your strengths right now?  MASON PLUMLEE:Ã‚Â\\xa0 My strengths right now are being athletic, getting up and down the floor, getting on the boards and finishing on the rim.  Things I have to work on is I have to be able to knock down shots consistently.Ã‚Â\\xa0 That's not something I did in college.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I didn't attempt jumpshots.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I think that's something that can add a whole new dimension to my game.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I know this team has gone through a lot of roster changes, trade rumors.Ã‚Â\\xa0 What do you envision your role being on this team going into next year?  MASON PLUMLEE:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I'm just happy to be a part of the team right now.Ã‚Â\\xa0 We'll figure all that out come camp.Ã‚Â\\xa0 But I'm a basketball player, you put me on the floor, I'm going to play my game.Ã‚Â\\xa0 We'll go from there.

VICTOR OLADIPO:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I'm really looking forward to it.Ã‚Â\\xa0 They're in a rebuilding process.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I'm just glad they chose me so I could be a part of that.Ã‚Â\\xa0 In Indiana we had a huge rebuilding process, so I know what it takes.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I'm looking forward to going there and working hard and playing at a high level and help impact winning.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Victor, as a rookie going to a team with veteran leadership and you have to make your role.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Talk about how it's going to be as a young guy who is going to be joining another cast of young guys, and how you're going to be able to create yourself and find a role in the locker room.  VICTOR OLADIPO:Ã‚Â\\xa0 There's no question they've been there and they've done it.Ã‚Â\\xa0 So going into a program like that, I definitely have to earn my teammates' respect.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I'm not trying to come in and do everything and try to outshine everybody.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I'm going to come in and work hard.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Because they're definitely a great program and they've got young kids who are working hard.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I'm definitely looking forward to be a part of that.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Victor, first of all, congratulations.Ã‚Â\\xa0 When did you have a sense it was going to be Orlando?Ã‚Â\\xa0 And what do you feel about that roster and how you fit that roster?  VICTOR OLADIPO:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I had a sense when they called my name.Ã‚Â\\xa0 My agent wouldn't tell me.Ã‚Â\\xa0 It was kind of tough, but it was exciting.  I love the roster.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Like you said, there's young great talent on there.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I'm just looking forward to be a part of that, and helping them win.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Victor, you've gotten a lot of comparisons to Dwyane Wade, your type of game.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Do you see that in yourself?Ã‚Â\\xa0 Are you that type of player?  VICTOR OLADIPO:Ã‚Â\\xa0 You know, there's different parts of my game that compare to him, but at the end of the day I'm just trying to be the best Victor Oladipo as possible.  He's a great player and someone I actually look up to, and I can't wait to go against him on the court.Ã‚Â\\xa0 It's going to be fun.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Yesterday you discussed how your parents thought this was just a hobby, that you were eventually going to give up.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Now that you're here, you're the No. 2 pick, what's the feeling your family has right now to see you reach this point and be the No. 2 pick?  VICTOR OLADIPO:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I don't even know if my family still knows what's going on.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I know they're happy.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I know they're happy for me.Ã‚Â\\xa0 This is probably a surreal feeling for them, too, to see the youngest, the baby boy, grow up to be the gentleman that I am today.Ã‚Â\\xa0 And even in that aspect, I'm just getting started as a young man; just turned 21.Ã‚Â\\xa0 So a long life ahead of me.  I'm just looking forward to making each day the best day and just getting better from one day to the next.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Were you outside when Cody got picked?Ã‚Â\\xa0 And what does it mean for both of you guys to be picked in the top four?  VICTOR OLADIPO:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Yeah, I was out there when he got picked.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I'm not surprised he got picked where he got picked.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I was cheering just as loud as everybody else.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I know how hard both of us worked to get to this point.Ã‚Â\\xa0 It's huge for the Indiana Hoosier program for us to go in the top four.Ã‚Â\\xa0 That program deserves the best because it is the best.  For us to just grow as players and as men in that program and then have the opportunity to be the No. 2 and No. 4 pick in the draft is a surreal feeling.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Victor, congratulations on being drafted by a team that plays in a state with no income tax.Ã‚Â\\xa0 You mentioned your agent.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I'm always curious about this, is it like Jerry McGuire when you're a top athlete and people want to represent you?Ã‚Â\\xa0 What was that process like?  VICTOR OLADIPO:Ã‚Â\\xa0 It wasn't very difficult for me.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I kind of say in every situation in my life, divine intervention leads me to all my goals in all aspects of my life.Ã‚Â\\xa0 It was divine intervention that got me‑‑  Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 But was it like Jerry McGuire with people making crazy promises?  VICTOR OLADIPO:Ã‚Â\\xa0 The thing with me is I shut it down.Ã‚Â\\xa0 During the season I didn't get any calls from anybody.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I wasn't accepting any calls.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Whoever reached any of my coaches, whether it be Coach Stevens, my AAU coach, my high school or Coach Crean, they didn't mention it to me.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I was just focused on Indiana basketball and winning.Ã‚Â\\xa0 If they tried, they didn't get to me.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 How did the process open up?  VICTOR OLADIPO:Ã‚Â\\xa0 After the season I sat down with my coaches, and we got a select few guys and we interviewed each of them.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I narrowed it down to two, and I had to meet with my family.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I feel like after I met with my family, my family has my best interests in my heart.Ã‚Â\\xa0 They have that sense of comfort.Ã‚Â\\xa0 All sides point to Raymond Brothers, who is my agent right now.Ã‚Â\\xa0 He means a lot to me already.Ã‚Â\\xa0 He's done so much for me already.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I'm just glad we're together and he's definitely going to fight this fight I'm about to fight with me.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I'm looking forward to each day.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Who do you have here with you tonight to celebrate?Ã‚Â\\xa0 What does that mean?  VICTOR OLADIPO:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I tried to bring the whole DMV with me.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I got my sisters, my mom, my agent, and my father actually came today, which means a lot to me as well.Ã‚Â\\xa0 It was hard for him definitely to come to a lot of my games.Ã‚Â\\xa0 But for him to be here today is an amazing feeling.  A lot of my friends, a lot of my coaches and their family.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Just my circle, my inner circle.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I'm just glad that they're here to share this experience with me.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Victor, after the past weeks and months of uncertainty, what's it like when you hear them tell you where you're going to live?Ã‚Â\\xa0 You have a team and a roster?Ã‚Â\\xa0 Moving forward with more clarity, what's that like?  VICTOR OLADIPO:Ã‚Â\\xa0 It's like a weight vest you took off after running five miles.Ã‚Â\\xa0 It's relaxing, man.Ã‚Â\\xa0 But at the same time, you know it's just getting started, man.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I'm just looking forward to getting there, getting to Orlando, meeting my teammates.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I can't wait to meet my teammates.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Just create a bond with them.Ã‚Â\\xa0 That will definitely help us on the court and go to war with them every night.  \"}, 'Nerlens Noel': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=90517', 'text': \"Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Nerlens, there are reports you're going to be traded to the Philadelphia 76ers.Ã‚Â\\xa0 How do you feel about being a Sixer?

Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Coach Calipari and the players that have come out of Kentucky and the tradition that over the past five years that have come out of that university, talk about what are the things, the advice he's given you to be able to prepare immediately for the next level.  NERLENS NOEL:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Coach Calipari is the ultimate teacher.Ã‚Â\\xa0 He's taught me so much on and off the court.Ã‚Â\\xa0 He's been a great mentor to me keeping my head up through this injury and really working hard.Ã‚Â\\xa0 He's giving me a lot of motivation.  I mean, he's taught me a lot.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I'm not the only guy like myself.Ã‚Â\\xa0 He's been in this game awhile.Ã‚Â\\xa0 He's had a lot of successful guys that have gone and done good things in the NBA.

Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 What's your take on Coach Howland and what happened, how he was let go?  SHABAZZ MUHAMMAD:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Yeah, I thought we had a really great season.Ã‚Â\\xa0 We won the Pac 12 Conference.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Had really good wins, key wins against Arizona and teams like that.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I thought he should have stayed, but you know how business works.Ã‚Â\\xa0 And I still talk to him.Ã‚Â\\xa0 We have a really good relationship.Ã‚Â\\xa0 And he's a great guy.

SHABAZZ MUHAMMAD:Ã‚Â\\xa0 It's going to be great.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I'm really going to be soaking in that advice.Ã‚Â\\xa0 He's such a great coach.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I remember when he was coaching with Sacramento back in the day when they used to run against the Lakers.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 And Portland.  SHABAZZ MUHAMMAD:Ã‚Â\\xa0 And Portland.Ã‚Â\\xa0 You can go on and on.Ã‚Â\\xa0 He has so much wisdom.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I'm just going to learn from him and the whole coaching staff.Ã‚Â\\xa0 It's going to be a really good thing for me.

TONY MITCHELL:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Not at all.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Not at all.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Things happen for a reason.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I just have to prove myself right now.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Guys were selected in front of me.Ã‚Â\\xa0 You still got to step on the court and lace up your shoes and play.Ã‚Â\\xa0 So at this point, man, I'm just ready to play.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Speaking of ready to play, how focused are you to be very competitive, because you have guys like Drummond up front and Greg Monroe and those guys, to get minutes?  TONY MITCHELL:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Just being competitive each and every day.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Play your hardest.Ã‚Â\\xa0 You have guys that are in the league.Ã‚Â\\xa0 You weren't selected at all for no reason, you know what I'm saying?Ã‚Â\\xa0 I'm just ready to compete and play.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I know you've talked in the past about how crazy your interview was with the Pistons.Ã‚Â\\xa0 What were your thoughts leaving that interview?Ã‚Â\\xa0 Did you think they might draft you after going through that?  TONY MITCHELL:Ã‚Â\\xa0 To be honest, man, I didn't think I would be in this position at all.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Like I said, like he said, everything happens for a reason.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I'm just blessed right now.Ã‚Â\\xa0 That interview was intense.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Really intense.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Tony, obviously I think you had expectations to go a little higher than you did.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Talk about those emotions of not going where you thought you were, and now you're into the second round.  TONY MITCHELL:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Of course you get down a little bit about yourself.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Like I said, everything happens for a reason.Ã‚Â\\xa0 You just got to keep moving forward.Ã‚Â\\xa0 It's a blessing to even be in this position in the first place.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Even though your draft stock slips a little bit, you still have to lace up your shoes and play.Ã‚Â\\xa0 That's what I'm ready to do.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Does it tell you something?Ã‚Â\\xa0 Do you learn about yourself as you go through this?Ã‚Â\\xa0 Do you learn about how teams view you?  TONY MITCHELL:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Most definitely.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Most definitely.Ã‚Â\\xa0 You learn a lot just by being in the process of what teams look for and what they expect of you each and every day as an NBA athlete.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I just mean the process of falling in the draft.  TONY MITCHELL:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Yeah, yeah, yeah.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Of course.Ã‚Â\\xa0 You learn everything about you just during that process for them to select you.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Does this put a chip on your shoulder?Ã‚Â\\xa0 Do you not approach it that way?  TONY MITCHELL:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Of course.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Of course.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Just like a Gilbert Arenas approach, what he went through.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I'm on the same thing he's on right now.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 You're going to try to get the number zero?  TONY MITCHELL:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Yeah.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I'm going to stick with 13.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I'm just going to play my hardest pretty much.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I don't know if this was covered already, why did you decide to come to the draft when the guys in the second round sometimes stay home?  TONY MITCHELL:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I just decided to come just because of my family.Ã‚Â\\xa0 My family wanted to be away from the home, just to experience the draft experience, being able to walk on stage and stuff like that.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 What was your Pistons experience like?Ã‚Â\\xa0 Did you get some vibes from them?Ã‚Â\\xa0 Did they give you an idea going into this?  TONY MITCHELL:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Not at all.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I didn't think I was going to be selected by the Pistons.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Like I said, everything happens for a reason.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I'm blessed to be in this position.

BEN McLEMORE:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I definitely can say I come in with a chip on my shoulder.Ã‚Â\\xa0 That's what I want to do.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I want to come in and show everybody what I can do, because I know on the court I know what I can do.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I can be an alpha dog and take over games and help my teams win games.  Like I said, I definitely think coming in I definitely got a chip on my shoulder, but I know I can handle it right.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I know I'm going to go in there and work.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 The Kings are officially now in Sacramento.Ã‚Â\\xa0 They're not moving.  BEN McLEMORE:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Yeah.

Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 During the draft LeBron Tweeted that the teams were sleeping on Ben McLemore, since you weren't taken first overall or up there.Ã‚Â\\xa0 How does that make you feel?

Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Ben, two things:Ã‚Â\\xa0 How well do you know LeBron?

Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Also, you talked about the chip.Ã‚Â\\xa0 In Kansas they know you as a nice guy.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Sitting at the table, how much did dropping to 7, I know that's not low, but how much did dropping like that contribute to this chip?Ã‚Â\\xa0 Were you feeling it right there tonight?  BEN McLEMORE:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Definitely.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I think I've been feeling it since I've been here.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Since I've been in workouts.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I'm just ready, prepared to show everybody what I can do, and everybody saw me play this past season.Ã‚Â\\xa0 They've seen I've show spurts.Ã‚Â\\xa0 And I'm ready to head to the next level and do what I got to do.

BEN McLEMORE:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I practiced it.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I definitely did it tonight.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I've been practicing it.Ã‚Â\\xa0 It's a nice tie.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 You've got a great personality.Ã‚Â\\xa0 This would have been a great endorsement situation.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Sacramento is not known for being a big endorsement market.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Is that frustrating for you and your business people?Ã‚Â\\xa0 If you were in a bigger market I can see where you can do really well.  BEN McLEMORE:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Not at all.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Me and my peoples are going to do what's best for us and best for me as far as marketing.Ã‚Â\\xa0Ã‚Â\\xa0 We're going to find a way to market me.

McCollum': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=90521', 'text': 'Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 C.J., congratulations to you.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Talk about Damian Lillard, you have similar games, very explosive.Ã‚Â\\xa0 How are you guys going to be able to create matchup problems next season?  C.J. McCOLLUM:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I think offensively we\\'re both going to be a handful, scoring in multiple ways.Ã‚Â\\xa0 We have scoring off the dribble.Ã‚Â\\xa0 We have scoring‑‑ playing off the ball.Ã‚Â\\xa0 One of the things people don\\'t know is we\\'re both unselfish.Ã‚Â\\xa0 For a win we want to do whatever is necessary to win.Ã‚Â\\xa0 People will see that as we get to play together.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 What was the moment where this night seemed the farthest away from you with all the challenges you faced?Ã‚Â\\xa0 And what does it mean to be here?  C.J. McCOLLUM:Ã‚Â\\xa0 It seemed challenging when I was 5\\'2\" my freshman in high school.Ã‚Â\\xa0 It seemed a little closer when I got to college.Ã‚Â\\xa0 When I broke my foot it seemed a bit farther away.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Throughout my senior year I realized I had a really good chance to go to the NBA.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 C.J., congratulations.Ã‚Â\\xa0 You played baseball and it was kind of a blessing in disguise, right?Ã‚Â\\xa0 You were allergic to grass.Ã‚Â\\xa0 You almost ended up being a baseball player.  C.J. McCOLLUM:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Baseball was my best sport growing up.Ã‚Â\\xa0 But it was kind of boring.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Basketball was more intense.Ã‚Â\\xa0 And I like the fact that when I shot threes, they\\'d yell \"three!\" and stuff like that.  The fact that I was allergic to grass, that did have a huge factor in me deciding to stop playing it.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 C.J., did you play one‑one‑one with your brother in the last 24 hours?Ã‚Â\\xa0 And if so, who won?  C.J. McCOLLUM:Ã‚Â\\xa0 No, we did not.Ã‚Â\\xa0 However, I do have a flight to Portland maybe or maybe not.Ã‚Â\\xa0 If he takes the flight, he can take the flight.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Big night.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I have to ask, Lehigh known for engineers, but not exactly known for professional athletes.Ã‚Â\\xa0 How did you pick Lehigh?Ã‚Â\\xa0 Did you think about coming to the Ivy League?Ã‚Â\\xa0 We could have used you at Colombia.  C.J. McCOLLUM:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Lehigh picked me.Ã‚Â\\xa0 It was a situation I hadn\\'t heard of them.Ã‚Â\\xa0 But they gave me a chance.Ã‚Â\\xa0 The coaching staff was great from the beginning.Ã‚Â\\xa0 One of the first schools to recruit me.  The Ivy League, one of the things I didn\\'t like isÃ‚Â\\xa0 they didn\\'t give full‑ride scholarships.Ã‚Â\\xa0 So there was no chance I was going to the Ivy League.  Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 C.J., you have spoken a lot about feeling like you always have to overcome, that there were always doubters.Ã‚Â\\xa0 How long do you embrace this moment?Ã‚Â\\xa0 And do you wake up tomorrow saying I got to start proving it all over again?  C.J. McCOLLUM:Ã‚Â\\xa0 You have to prove yourself night in and night out.Ã‚Â\\xa0 That\\'s one of the things I pride myself in. Ã‚Â\\xa0I\\'m going to enjoy this moment tonight with my friends and family and definitely celebrate and take it all in.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Tomorrow is back to work, back to business.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Whether I have a press conference or not, I have to get ready for the summer league and the next step, the challenge of being in the NBA.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Did you ever get an inkling maybe the Trailblazers were more interested in you than some other teams?  C.J. McCOLLUM:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I knew they were interested, if that answers your question.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I don\\'t know about more interested.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Maybe.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 C.J., last year we saw Damian Lillard quite a bit.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Kind of a versatile type of guard.Ã‚Â\\xa0 How can you be in that type of system?Ã‚Â\\xa0 Can you be versatile to play both systems if Damian is doing the same?  C.J. McCOLLUM:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Absolutely.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I feel I can play both positions.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I played both positions in college.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I\\'ve gotten stronger and bigger and more wise.Ã‚Â\\xa0 So I have a greater understanding of the game.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I\\'m trying to fulfill a role, whatever is necessary.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Whether it coming off the bench, playing beside him.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I don\\'t care.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I\\'m in the NBA.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 First of all, congratulations.Ã‚Â\\xa0 You have a big fan in Damian Lillard.Ã‚Â\\xa0 He\\'s been all over Twitter.Ã‚Â\\xa0 He was with us in the draft process, you might be the best player in the draft.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Now you\\'re going to play with him.Ã‚Â\\xa0 How do you feel about that?  C.J. McCOLLUM:Ã‚Â\\xa0 It\\'s a blessing to be able to play in the NBA.Ã‚Â\\xa0 It\\'s even more blessing to be able to play with Rookie of the Year.Ã‚Â\\xa0 A guy you can learn from.Ã‚Â\\xa0 A guy who has been in similar situations as you.Ã‚Â\\xa0 He seemed like he\\'s where I\\'m trying to get.Ã‚Â\\xa0 He has a great understanding of the game.Ã‚Â\\xa0 He\\'s had a huge impact his rookie year.Ã‚Â\\xa0 One of two rookies to play all 82 games.Ã‚Â\\xa0 He led the NBA in minutes.  I got a lot to learn and I look forward to it.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 First of all, congratulations on behalf of all of us.Ã‚Â\\xa0 One of the things I noticed being in that room was you got one of the loudest receptions out of all the guys that got drafted up to that point.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Talk a little about the Lehigh University fan support.Ã‚Â\\xa0 You have a lot of teammates, a lot of alumni here to support you.Ã‚Â\\xa0Ã‚Â\\xa0 What is that feeling like today?  C.J. McCOLLUM:Ã‚Â\\xa0 It\\'s an amazing feeling.Ã‚Â\\xa0 To see people shout my name and to recognize faces.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I\\'m getting interviewed by a guy I know in Carl.Ã‚Â\\xa0 It\\'s crazy.Ã‚Â\\xa0 The type of love and support we get at Lehigh.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I know we\\'ve never had an NBA player before.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Second player drafted from the Patriot League.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Hopefully Mike\\'s name will get called soon. This is just a blessing.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I\\'m blessed to be able to represent my home state, my city, Lehigh and my family.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Trey, you are an NBA player now, and I\\'m sure your coaches gave you a lot of advice or words to encourage you or to support you.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Can you tell us which word inspired you most?  C.J. McCOLLUM:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I talked to coach.Ã‚Â\\xa0 My name is C.J. McCollum.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Sorry.  MICHAEL CARTER‑WILLIAMS:Ã‚Â\\xa0 It\\'s all right.Ã‚Â\\xa0 He basically told me just continue to do what I\\'ve been doing.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Be myself.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Work hard, and everything will fall into place.Ã‚Â\\xa0 That\\'s one of the biggest things.Ã‚Â\\xa0 You have to be yourself.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 C.J., what is the one thing that you don\\'t know about the NBA that you\\'re eager to find out?  C.J. McCOLLUM:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Is that a trick question?Ã‚Â\\xa0 I don\\'t know anything about the NBA.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I\\'ve never played there.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I\\'ve researched it and only heard stories.Ã‚Â\\xa0 It\\'s one thing to read it and watch it on TV.Ã‚Â\\xa0 You can tell me how good Chris Paul is but you don\\'t know until you go head to head with him.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I\\'m a rookie and there\\'s a reason they call us rooks.

Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Talk about your opportunity with Milwaukee and looking to get minutes.Ã‚Â\\xa0 What areas in your game is going to help you get those minutes?Ã‚Â\\xa0 And also it's kind of a rebuilding team, too.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Looks like Monta Ellis isn't coming back.Ã‚Â\\xa0 So how can you fit in?

RICKY LEDO:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I see myself fitting in well.Ã‚Â\\xa0 At the two guard position.Ã‚Â\\xa0 They don't really have two guards right now.Ã‚Â\\xa0 So I feel like just me stepping in that position and showing that I can score and be a great player and great teammate in summer league and eventually making the team.

Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 You talked about maybe trading, when you came to the draft tonight, maybe a player or a pick.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Why do you feel you didn't make any moves other than‑‑ BILLY KING:Ã‚Â\\xa0 There was a lot of activity.Ã‚Â\\xa0 As you guys will find out, there will be a lot of trades that are announced.Ã‚Â\\xa0 We looked at it, we looked to moving back.Ã‚Â\\xa0 As we looked and we saw we had Mason ranked on the board, with him being there, that's why we selected him.  We looked at all scenarios, to move out, moveup.Ã‚Â\\xa0 We were aggressive trying to move up.Ã‚Â\\xa0 As we saw the board unfold, we liked where we stood.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Did the Blatche's free agency have anything to do with selecting a center?  BILLY KING:Ã‚Â\\xa0 No, I don't think it was anything in particular with Blatche's free agency.Ã‚Â\\xa0 You like to have five bigs.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Adding another young one helps.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Can we expect to see a press conference with you on July 10th, possibly major press conference, involving a lot of players with jerseys?  BILLY KING:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I have no idea.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Unless you have had a change of heart in the last minute and a half and want to talk about other things, were there surprises in your mind in the draft especially up top?Ã‚Â\\xa0 Like the No. 1 pick?  BILLY KING:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Yeah.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I think there were some things that happened that we were pretty surprised.Ã‚Â\\xa0 But the one thing you always find in the draft is people do their own research, their own background and select guys.Ã‚Â\\xa0 You can think back to when Sam Presti selected Westbrook as high as he did, some people questioned it, or Harden.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I don't look at the draft and question why people do things.Ã‚Â\\xa0 In the end of the day they do all the hard work and they have to select.  When you project it and it doesn't work out‑‑ it doesn't go the way you think, it's surprising.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I never criticize anybody in the draft.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Nobody knows what the draft is going to be like until three, four years.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Then people look back and say wow, we could have had that guy.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Given Mason is a four‑year college player, how quick do you expect him to step into the rotation?  BILLY KING:Ã‚Â\\xa0 It's up to him.Ã‚Â\\xa0 There's no timetable on him.Ã‚Â\\xa0 He gets to play in summer league.Ã‚Â\\xa0 He gets to go to Orlando, participate in Jason Kidd's first head‑coaching experience.  But the great thing about being a four‑year player is I think he's been through a lot.Ã‚Â\\xa0 He's mature and understands that he still has work to do.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Just approaching free agency, last year you had players, tried to get Deron and a couple of guys.Ã‚Â\\xa0 This year what do you expect to do with you guys capped out in free agency?  BILLY KING:Ã‚Â\\xa0 We have our taxpayer mid‑level.Ã‚Â\\xa0 We have the minimum.Ã‚Â\\xa0 So we have some guys we've targeted.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Jason and I have been talking.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I gave him a list of some guys to call come 12:01 on the first.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Since the move to Brooklyn and even before that point, the message from your team has been, we want to build for a championship.Ã‚Â\\xa0 As you think about the roster you're building for the future, do you feel like winning that championship you're getting to a point where that's not just lip service anymore as you build?  BILLY KING:Ã‚Â\\xa0 With Mason?Ã‚Â\\xa0 Yes.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Roster for the future?  BILLY KING:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I can address that later, hopefully.

SERGEY KARASEV:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I think I talked about Zydrunas Ilgauskas last year.Ã‚Â\\xa0 It was something like we're going to‑‑ it wasn't something like we're going to take you or something about the draft.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Just friendly talk.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 What is it going to be like adjusting to play for Mike Brown instead of your dad and for playing with Kyrie Irving?  SERGEY KARASEV:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I think here coaches, players, highest level.Ã‚Â\\xa0 So it's my dream to play here, and every time I want to grow up.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I think Kyrie Irving helped me with this and Mike Brown, too.Ã‚Â\\xa0 So I enjoy this time.

GORGUI DIENG:Ã‚Â\\xa0 You know, if somebody, like, knows my game, I\\'m very competitive.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I just play hard and I just do whatever that the coach want me to do.Ã‚Â\\xa0 That\\'s how Coach P taught me how to play the game.Ã‚Â\\xa0 \"Listen to your coach and try to please him.\"Ã‚Â\\xa0 I think if I go to Minnesota I can learn‑‑ they have veterans up there.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I can learn from them.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Some day I will become a great basketball player.

ALLEN CRABBE:Ã‚Â\\xa0 They have a great point guard in Kyrie Irving.Ã‚Â\\xa0 They're a young team.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I feel like they have good youth and good guys around that will help us, help me as a player compete.Ã‚Â\\xa0 And just like I said, just find the areas in my game that need work and go out this and work extra hard at it just to get better, so I can come in and contribute somewhat.

Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I wanted to ask you about Philadelphia.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Seems like you have the keys to the car now to drive it.Ã‚Â\\xa0 So what are the things in your game you feel you have to work on so you're completely prepared to be able to lead this team?  MICHAEL CARTER‑WILLIAMS:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I think that I've been working on my overall game a lot, and I've been working on my shooting.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I've been trying to get back in the groove of just doing defensive slides and different man‑to‑man drills.Ã‚Â\\xa0 So I'm ready.  I think I'm a quick learner and I'll adapt to the NBA fast.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Especially like you said, how I have the keys to the car.Ã‚Â\\xa0 So the NBA speed is different.Ã‚Â\\xa0 So I think I'll pick it up real quick.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Michael, congratulations.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Welcome to town.Ã‚Â\\xa0 The Sixers are a team that's in great transition.Ã‚Â\\xa0 According to reports, they traded Jrue Holiday, which opens the door to come in and show what you can do at the point guard position.Ã‚Â\\xa0 They don't have a coach right now.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I wonder how much you know about the direction that team intends to take and where you fit into the Sixers' plans right now.  MICHAEL CARTER‑WILLIAMS:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I look at the bright side.Ã‚Â\\xa0 They don't have a coach.Ã‚Â\\xa0 As soon as they get a new coach, he's going to come in and want to get started on a positive note.Ã‚Â\\xa0 He's going to establish the way he wants to coach a team and the way he wants us to play.  So I think it couldn't go any better.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I can learn from it right away and learn the right way from the beginning.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Michael, the Sixers have just traded an All‑Star point guard.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Basically putting you in that spot.Ã‚Â\\xa0 How do you feel about that pressure?  MICHAEL CARTER‑WILLIAMS:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I haven't thought too deeply about it.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I'm just happy right now.Ã‚Â\\xa0 But I realize it.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I just‑‑ I have a lot of confidence in myself, and Philadelphia has a lot of confidence in me.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I'm going to go there and play my best.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I'm just going to go out there and perform every night like I can.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 It looks like you'll have Nerlens Noel with you.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Having a big guy like that, starting to get excited about this opportunity?  MICHAEL CARTER‑WILLIAMS:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I'm really excited.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Me and Nerlens grew up together.Ã‚Â\\xa0 We're best friends.Ã‚Â\\xa0 We played on the same AAU team in high school.Ã‚Â\\xa0 It's like a dream come true.Ã‚Â\\xa0 We always talked about how we were both going to make it to the NBA.Ã‚Â\\xa0 For us to end up on the same team is a blessing.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Mike, I actually had the pleasure of watching you grow up and play in Boston, being from Boston.Ã‚Â\\xa0 And I think I played against you in a camp when I was younger.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Talk about what it means to represent the city of Boston.Ã‚Â\\xa0 With Nerlens down in Philadelphia, and have you talked to him already?  MICHAEL CARTER‑WILLIAMS:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I haven't talked to him yet.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I can't wait.Ã‚Â\\xa0 But it means a lot.Ã‚Â\\xa0 We're big leaders and idols for the kids in Boston.Ã‚Â\\xa0 And a lot of people look up to us and follow us.Ã‚Â\\xa0 So it means a lot.Ã‚Â\\xa0 For us to just play on the same team is great.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I'm sure we're going to have a lot of support and a lot of love.Ã‚Â\\xa0 We just appreciate it.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Just sticking with the Nerlens pick.Ã‚Â\\xa0 How many years have you played in the ABC with him?Ã‚Â\\xa0 He went sixth.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I'm sure you thought he was going higher.  MICHAEL CARTER‑WILLIAMS:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I played two or three years with Nerlens, but I was surprised I went sixth, but it's how things end up.Ã‚Â\\xa0 It was meant to be.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I'm sure he has a chip on his shoulder now, and who knows, maybe that's what he needed for him to be great in the NBA.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Maybe this pushes him to work harder.Ã‚Â\\xa0 That's what it should do for him.  I know he's happy as ever to play with me, also.Ã‚Â\\xa0 So to look at it in that perspective is great.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Would you like to play the point guard or the two guard or do you think you can switch, combo?Ã‚Â\\xa0 Which position would you like?  MICHAEL CARTER‑WILLIAMS:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I think offensively I have a point guard mindset.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I've come from the point guard position.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I think on the defensive end since I'm a bigger guard, I'm going to be able to defend two or three positions.Ã‚Â\\xa0 So either way basketball is basketball.Ã‚Â\\xa0 But I think that I'm a point guard at heart.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 You're basically going to be a starting point guard in Philadelphia in a rebuild.Ã‚Â\\xa0 That seems like a lot of pressure.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I'm sure you haven't thought about it yet.Ã‚Â\\xa0 How do you think you can deal with the pressure?Ã‚Â\\xa0 And just the expectations you'll have going into a city with such passion fanbase like Philadelphia?  MICHAEL CARTER‑WILLIAMS:Ã‚Â\\xa0 There is some pressure there.Ã‚Â\\xa0 No doubt about it.Ã‚Â\\xa0 But I'm just‑‑ I'm going to use it as motivation and just work hard every day to try to get better and better.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I've been dealing with a lot of pressure coming from Syracuse and having the ball in my hands my sophomore year after a bunch of guys left, and it was my job to lead the team.Ã‚Â\\xa0 It's not the exact situation.Ã‚Â\\xa0 But it's a similar situation.

TREY BURKE:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I think the only reason why I kind of got a little nervous after Detroit is because I didn't really work out for any teams after that.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I didn't know how far I was going to slip back into the draft.  So I was just waiting for someone to call my name.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Like I said, the Timberwolves called me, and I got traded five minutes later.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I don't know what to really think right now.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I'm happy to be at Utah.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I'm just ready to get my career started.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Trey, we've talked a couple of times about you needing to land in a situation to be the leader.Ã‚Â\\xa0 You've got a young guy in Derrick Favors and Enes Cantor, Alex Burke.Ã‚Â\\xa0 You have all the tools.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Are you the guys who is going to bring the playoffs to the Utah Jazz?  TREY BURKE:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I think I'm definitely capable.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I just needed the opportunity.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Utah, the Miller family and Coach gave me an opportunity to try to help this team win.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I'm looking forward to it.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Trey, as you probably know, the Jazz have a strong history with Rickey Green, John Stockton, Deron Williams.Ã‚Â\\xa0 They bring their own style to the game.Ã‚Â\\xa0 What are you going to bring to Utah we haven't seen before?  TREY BURKE:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I'm sure you've seen it with John Stockton and guys like like Deron Williams.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I think the winning mentality and the guy that's going to work hard and make plays for this team.Ã‚Â\\xa0 This is a new journey for me, but I'm looking forward to making an impact right away and helping this team go far.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Trey, talk about coming from the University of Michigan.Ã‚Â\\xa0 There's NBA talent galore that were your teammates.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Talk about how the competition and practices and just the motivation of you guys really pushed you to be where you're at.  TREY BURKE:Ã‚Â\\xa0 The competition was at an all‑time high level at Michigan.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I think that's what made us really good.Ã‚Â\\xa0 We competed against each other each day in practice.Ã‚Â\\xa0 And we pushed each other to get the potential out of each other.  I think that helped us all get better.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I'm glad to say that I've came from a university like Michigan.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 How great is it for you and Tim to be both drafted in the first round?  TREY BURKE:Ã‚Â\\xa0 It's great.Ã‚Â\\xa0 It's an honor and an accomplishment that we've been waiting for our whole life.Ã‚Â\\xa0 And it's an opportunity that we've always wanted.Ã‚Â\\xa0 So I wish him the best.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I know he'll do great.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Trey, you had eight teams pass on you.Ã‚Â\\xa0 One team trade you.Ã‚Â\\xa0 You were lower than you thought.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Is that fuel for the fire at this point?  TREY BURKE:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I'm happy where I'm at.Ã‚Â\\xa0 It's a blessing to be in Utah and playing for the Jazz.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I think the type of player that I am, I definitely get motivated by things like that.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Teams passing up on me.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Not knowing what to expect at the end of the day.  So I definitely think it will motivate me.Ã‚Â\\xa0 It will make me get in the gym more.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Just get better, continue to work hard.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Trey, congratulations.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Can you take us through what was going through your head from the moment you were selected until now with the whole trade and who you were talking to?  TREY BURKE:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Well, it was kind of a shocker that the Timberwolves selected me.Ã‚Â\\xa0 So I was kind of thrown off a little bit.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I was happy at the same time.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I was excited.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I got to walk across the stage that I've been watching since I was a little kid.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Once I found out I was getting traded, it was kind of like, what do I do?Ã‚Â\\xa0 I had the hat on and everything.Ã‚Â\\xa0 So I didn't really know what to do.Ã‚Â\\xa0 They told me to sit in the back room until it was confirmed.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Now that it's confirmed, I'm happy to be in Utah.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Trey, I want to ask you about your teammate Tim who got drafted by the Knicks a little while ago.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Fluid situation with the Knicks with J.R. Smith telling the team he's going to opt it and test free agency.Ã‚Â\\xa0 There's an opening for somebody who can score.Ã‚Â\\xa0 How do you think he's going to fit in New York?  TREY BURKE:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I think he's going to fit perfectly.Ã‚Â\\xa0 That's the kind of player he is.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Tim Hardaway is a team player first.Ã‚Â\\xa0 That's what's most important, what he brings to teams.Ã‚Â\\xa0 He has that NBA gene in him.Ã‚Â\\xa0 He's a great high‑volume shooter who can get hot in any second.Ã‚Â\\xa0 And I definitely think the Knicks didn't go wrong picking him.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Trey, now that you've actually been selected, how excited are you to get back to basketball and how long has it been since you've touched a basketball?Ã‚Â\\xa0 Is this like a record length for you?  TREY BURKE:Ã‚Â\\xa0 No, I touched a ball.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I got an opportunity to touch the ball yesterday.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 To actually play basketball?  TREY BURKE:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Yeah.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Two days ago they had me on the playground doing some photos.Ã‚Â\\xa0 It's great to be able to move past this process and just focus on basketball, get ready for summer camp, for summer league.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 What's your pin?Ã‚Â\\xa0 What's on the pin there on your jacket?Ã‚Â\\xa0 On your right side.  TREY BURKE:Ã‚Â\\xa0 No, it's just a pin that a guy offered me to wear.Ã‚Â\\xa0 It's a flower.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I had a regular one, but I think it just went with the tie.Ã‚Â\\xa0 So I think it was a good look for me.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 So does the hat.  TREY BURKE:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Absolutely.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Thank you.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Can you talk about the decision to go with your father as an agent.Ã‚Â\\xa0 How special was that for you and him?  TREY BURKE:Ã‚Â\\xa0 It's special, because he's a guy that I trust a lot.Ã‚Â\\xa0 He knows a lot about basketball, and he knows a lot of people.Ã‚Â\\xa0 So I felt like he was the right guy to go with.Ã‚Â\\xa0 And I felt like with the resources that we have around myself, I couldn't go wrong with going with somebody like my dad.Ã‚Â\\xa0 If he needed any type of knowledge, any type of input, I could use the resources that are surrounded by me.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 When we talked yesterday, you said you thought No. 8 was your floor.Ã‚Â\\xa0 What was it about the Pistons when they passed on you?Ã‚Â\\xa0 When they did, what went through your mind at that moment?  TREY BURKE:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I thought me coming from Michigan and them needing another guard, I thought I could end up going to Detroit.Ã‚Â\\xa0 But once they passed on me, I was kind of like, now I don't know where I'm going to go.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I hadn't worked out with any other teams past the No. 8 pick.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Luckily I was the next pick right after that.  So I was just excited.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I was excited to hear my name called.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Trey, how do you see your game translating to the next level?Ã‚Â\\xa0 And with the pieces around you in Utah, would you prefer to play up‑tempo like a lot of you guys did in college or would you prefer to be more of a half‑court team?  TREY BURKE:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I would prefer to be pretty balanced.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I know I have some really good shooters around me.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I think with the guys that the Jazz already have, we can get up and down the floor as well.Ã‚Â\\xa0 But I think I'm going to be a guy that's going to bring the winning mentality to the team, that can make plays.Ã‚Â\\xa0 And can get his teammates involved and score when I need to score and hit the open man when I need to hit the open man.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I think it's a feel for the game that I bring to a team like the Jazz.Ã‚Â\\xa0 And I'm looking forward to helping them win.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 There was a recent report Karl Malone is going to be helping out with the organization this upcoming season.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Talk about what he might bring to the table in terms of teaching and working the pick‑and‑roll with the Jazz.  TREY BURKE:Ã‚Â\\xa0 He can teach me a lot.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Especially reading the bigs, setting the screen, reading a big that's guarding the screen.Ã‚Â\\xa0 The screener.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Just giving me a lot of input about how to become a really good pro.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Karl Malone is an all‑time great.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I can definitely get a lot of feedback from him.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Are you going to start a foundation or anything to give back to the communities or anything like that?  TREY BURKE:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Yeah, absolutely.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Have you thought about it?  TREY BURKE:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Absolutely.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I'm always willing to give back to the communities.Ã‚Â\\xa0 It's a little early right now.Ã‚Â\\xa0 But I'm definitely willing to go back to my community, be an influence to the kids.Ã‚Â\\xa0 That's always been a dream of mine.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Definitely.

ANTHONY BENNETT:Ã‚Â\\xa0 At the same time, I'm really trying to create my own path.Ã‚Â\\xa0 But I feel like throughout the whole year Coach Rice at UNLV, Stacey Augmon and Heath Schroyer, basically all said like our game is similar.Ã‚Â\\xa0 So I went back ‑‑ it was like an off‑day.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I watched UNLV play Duke and beat them by 30 in the final.Ã‚Â\\xa0 It was pretty much similar.  I kind of see where the comparisons are coming from.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Congratulations, Anthony.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Can you talk about, are you surprised or did you see this coming after your interview in Cleveland?  ANTHONY BENNETT:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I'm just as surprised as everybody else.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I didn't really have any idea who's going No. 1 or who was going No. 2.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I heard everything was up for grabs.Ã‚Â\\xa0 But I'm just real happy, glad that I have this opportunity, and I just got to thank God for everything.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Anthony, can you describe just the emotions of just being a kid from Toronto to now being the first Canadian to go first overall?Ã‚Â\\xa0 What are your emotions and the thoughts about Canadian basketball?Ã‚Â\\xa0 Because there might be another one next year.  ANTHONY BENNETT:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Yeah.Ã‚Â\\xa0 It's just crazy.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Made history.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I can't really complain about that.Ã‚Â\\xa0 It's just like a long‑time dream that I had since I first started playing basketball, even though it was six or seven years ago.Ã‚Â\\xa0 It's just crazy.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Next year with (Andrew) Wiggins, hopefully he does well at Kansas.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I'm rooting for him.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I'm pretty sure he'll get that No. 1 spot.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Anthony, where do you see yourself right now fitting with the Cavs right away?  ANTHONY BENNETT:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I can contribute at the four, at the three.Ã‚Â\\xa0 You know, there's things I still need to work on, but I feel like I'm a great teammate, unselfish.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I think I can just fit in right away.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 How exciting is that you're going to be playing and getting lobs and dishes in the paint from Kyrie Irving?  ANTHONY BENNETT:Ã‚Â\\xa0 It's cool seeing him throughout the whole year.Ã‚Â\\xa0 He's putting up numbers.Ã‚Â\\xa0 He's doing his thing.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Now I can officially say he's my teammate.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Anthony, first of all, congratulations.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Yesterday we talked about this a little bit, scouts had said maybe you're the most pro‑ready player.Ã‚Â\\xa0 You're No. 1.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Do you feel you're pro‑ready?  ANTHONY BENNETT:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I would say I'm pro‑ready, but at the same time there's a lot of things I need to work on.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I made it, but I just need to keep working, trying to get a second contract, trying to do well for myself and the team.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Just got to keep grinding from here.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Anthony, you said you were surprised.Ã‚Â\\xa0 At what point in today were you maybe told this might happen, and when did you know it was going to happen?  ANTHONY BENNETT:Ã‚Â\\xa0 When they said my name.Ã‚Â\\xa0 That's when I knew when it happened.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I had no idea before, but like I said, all in God's work.  Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Have you got a congratulatory call from Prime Minister Steven Harper?Ã‚Â\\xa0 Is it only fair that Seth Jones be the No. 1 NHL draft on Sunday?  ANTHONY BENNETT:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I'm not a big fan of hockey, but I support the Maple Leafs.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Hopefully he does get picked No. 1.Ã‚Â\\xa0 It's crazy.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Great feeling, man.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Anthony, you and Tristan took the same path out of Toronto to Findlay Prep in Nevada.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I know he's watched you very close.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I assume he looks at you as a kind of younger brother.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Now you're in effect competing for playing time, but a teammate.Ã‚Â\\xa0 How much have you guys talked about this day and possibly playing together?  ANTHONY BENNETT:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I don't really talk to Tristan.Ã‚Â\\xa0 If I see him in person, we'll take 20 minutes out of our day just to chat it up.Ã‚Â\\xa0 But other than that, he's just a great guy.Ã‚Â\\xa0 He seems real cool.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Both from the same area.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I'm going to be seeing him a lot, basically.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Anthony, congratulations.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Back to what it means to you as a Canadian to be here like this, like you were saying, you're especially tight with Tristan, what's it's like to be on the same team from the same place?  ANTHONY BENNETT:Ã‚Â\\xa0 That Canadian connection.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Basically I had that throughout my whole basketball career, at UNLV with Khem Birch, Findlay Prep with Myck Kabongo.Ã‚Â\\xa0 It goes all around.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I'm really happy, I'm really excited and ready to take on this opportunity.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I know that some of the guys met with Harrison Barnes and his mom?  ANTHONY BENNETT:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I think that was the family meeting.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Harrison Barnes and Iguodala came this morning to talk to us about things in the league.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Did you give any advice about what's going to happen now?Ã‚Â\\xa0 Everything changes.  ANTHONY BENNETT:Ã‚Â\\xa0 They just said like you're on the bigger stage.Ã‚Â\\xa0 A lot of things are going to come your way.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Just stay level‑headed.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Stay humble.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Take care of your body, and everything should be fine.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 How familiar are you with Mike Brown and his coaching staff?Ã‚Â\\xa0 And do you think you'll have any trouble acclimating to the Cavs in the pro game?  ANTHONY BENNETT:Ã‚Â\\xa0 You know, when I went to Cleveland I think it was like last week, if not the week before, I really had a chance to meet with everybody.Ã‚Â\\xa0 And they seemed like a real great group of guys, just wants the best for me.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I just feel like my personality I can open up to anybody.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I can play with anybody.Ã‚Â\\xa0 It's just‑‑ there's no agendas for me.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I just want to be successful, win championships, and you know, just win games.  \"}, 'Giannis Antetokounmpo': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=90524', 'text': \"Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Giannis, congratulations.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Will you be playing for the Bucks this season or will you wait a while to come to play for the team?  GIANNIS ANTETOKOUNMPO:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I think for sure I will stay in the NBA, the Milwaukee Bucks.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Congratulations and we haven't seen a lot of your play, because you're in Europe and we're here.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Do you think you're going to mix well with the Bucks?Ã‚Â\\xa0 And are you going to be more offense or defense?  GIANNIS ANTETOKOUNMPO:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I'll be both.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I'm going to try my best.  Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Giannis, you were in to see Atlanta.Ã‚Â\\xa0 They were the only team that worked you out.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Were you surprised that it was Milwaukee?Ã‚Â\\xa0 It seemed like all indications it was Atlanta.

STEVEN ADAMS:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I'm going to go straight to Ibaka and try to study him first and see how he means around defensively and know‑‑ all I'm trying to work on right now is rebounding, blocking shots, defense and running the lanes.Ã‚Â\\xa0 All the base sort of stuff.Ã‚Â\\xa0 And then I'll start‑‑ from there I'll try to branch off or whatever.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Whatever the coaches want.Ã‚Â\\xa0 You know what I mean?   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Steven, talk about coming from Pitt, that physical type of play that Jamie Dixon emphasizes and how it will fit with this Oklahoma City Thunder team especially with that frontcourt and being with Kendrick Perkins.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Talk about how your game is going to fit in immediately, the style of play will fit in.  STEVEN ADAMS:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Like I said, I think they're looking forward to their transition game.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I know I can run the floor, but then again it starts off with defense and all that.Ã‚Â\\xa0 That's what their base‑‑ all the workouts we've done at OKC all of it was just defense, really.Ã‚Â\\xa0 That's all they are focused on.Ã‚Â\\xa0 That's all I'm focused on in getting better before we start doing any of the other stuff.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Steve, congratulations.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Can you tell me how different is your life going to be to life in New Zealand?Ã‚Â\\xa0 And what does this mean for basketball in New Zealand?  STEVEN ADAMS:Ã‚Â\\xa0 My life is going to be the same.Ã‚Â\\xa0 All I'm focused on is basketball.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Ain't going to change anything.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I think I'm pretty cool who I am.  But in terms of the basketball, I'm hoping that will skyrocket.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Right now that was the main plan.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Just instead of rugby, everybody's focused on rugby, they now have a different path to take and accomplish their goals, whether it be the NBA or whatever.Ã‚Â\\xa0 That was just the main one.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 How exciting is it to not only get drafted into the NBA, but now joining one of the better teams in the league in the Thunder?Ã‚Â\\xa0 Is that even better, hey, I'm an NBA player, I'm a Thunder player?  STEVEN ADAMS:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Definitely means I'm going to be a Thunder player.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I learned a lot about the history of what it means to put on the jersey.Ã‚Â\\xa0 So that's just one thing.Ã‚Â\\xa0 It's such a huge honor to be a Thunder player in itself.Ã‚Â\\xa0 To be an NBA player, it feels pretty cool, but I don't consider myself an NBA player yet.Ã‚Â\\xa0 It's just more I need to progress my game more and more and more, and then when somebody says hey, he's an NBA player now, then I'll start saying yes.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I'm an NBA player.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Congratulations.Ã‚Â\\xa0 You're going to a franchise that expects to compete for a championship next year.Ã‚Â\\xa0 That's a lot of expectation.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Are you ready for that?  STEVEN ADAMS:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Yeah.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Yup.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Yeah, I am.Ã‚Â\\xa0 All it is is‑‑ all I'm going to do is just be super supportive and help out in any way I can and just‑‑ even if it's just being on the bench or whatever like that, staying positive with the boys, just training hard and competing with them.Ã‚Â\\xa0 If that leads to a championship, I'll do it.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I'll do anything to win a championship.Ã‚Â\\xa0 That's the main goal for the whole organization.Ã‚Â\\xa0 That's the ultimate goal, you know what I mean?Ã‚Â\\xa0 We're all going to be on the same boat preparing for the same thing.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Congratulations for getting drafted.Ã‚Â\\xa0 How important is it to you to be going to a playoff team versus playing on a team that's on tough times?  STEVEN ADAMS:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I find for me I just see OKC as ‑‑ I looked at their development program and they kind of explained it.Ã‚Â\\xa0 That was one of the best that I had seen for all the workouts.Ã‚Â\\xa0 They're really professional about all‑‑ that's why I'm kind of like oh, that's cool.Ã‚Â\\xa0 That's really why I wanted to go there.Ã‚Â\\xa0 But in terms of them being a playoff‑‑ it's just a bonus.Ã‚Â\\xa0 That's like that's pretty cool, because we're all going for the same goal, as I said.Ã‚Â\\xa0 To get there maybe potentially next year, that's definitely a big plus.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Steven, what did it feel like when you're at Oklahoma?Ã‚Â\\xa0 What was the vibe you got from them?Ã‚Â\\xa0 And was this your hunch?  STEVEN ADAMS:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Yeah.Ã‚Â\\xa0 It was my hunch.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I don't know, they seemed to just‑‑ it was kind of hard to‑‑ I'm pretty bad with reading people.Ã‚Â\\xa0 They just seemed like cool people, like all the rest of the teams.Ã‚Â\\xa0 All the rest of the teams kind of liked me, I would think, I would hope.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Oklahoma kind of stood out.Ã‚Â\\xa0 It was like real‑‑ I don't know, wanted me to get there.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 What was the impression of the setup, theÃ‚Â\\xa0 personalities, the facilities in Oklahoma you're going to be part of for next season?Ã‚Â\\xa0 What was your impression of the setup that they have at Oklahoma and the personalities within the team?  STEVEN ADAMS:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Facility‑wise, that's amazing.Ã‚Â\\xa0 It's Disneyland for basketball players, it's so cool.Ã‚Â\\xa0 All the coaches in there were real good people and they knew a lot about basketball.Ã‚Â\\xa0 All they cared about was just getting better, progressing and reaching towards the championship.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I wouldn't be surprised if they do get a championship next year.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Their program is really, really good.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 We talked about New Zealand yesterday.Ã‚Â\\xa0 You could be the first person from New Zealand to actually visit Oklahoma City.Ã‚Â\\xa0 It's not actually one of the more sophisticated burbs.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Do you wish it could have been a more diverse town, a bigger market than Oklahoma City?  STEVEN ADAMS:Ã‚Â\\xa0 More diverse?Ã‚Â\\xa0 No.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I love Oklahoma City.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I learned about the history behind it and why they play and all the communities behind them.Ã‚Â\\xa0 They went through a tough time and they keep coming back.

JAMES YOUNG:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Definitely.Ã‚Â\\xa0 We can always build a relationship and definitely just start from there.  Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 James, talk about what you know about the rich history of the Celtics organization, if any.  JAMES YOUNG:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I really don't know that much about it, but I got to start doing my history now, I guess.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 James, sort of along those lines, you and Julius go to the two most storied franchises in the NBA.Ã‚Â\\xa0 He was giddy about his landing spot.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I assume you are as well.Ã‚Â\\xa0 What did you say with Calipari?Ã‚Â\\xa0 He said he was thrilled about where Julius landed.  JAMES YOUNG:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I'm really excited, like I said.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Cal said he had a feeling I was coming up soon.Ã‚Â\\xa0 When I got called, it was just a big smile on both our faces.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I came a long way, and Cal's been there for me.  Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 What do you make of that, you and Julius both ending up in maybe nontraditional spots for‑‑ you might go to a loser right away, and now you have a chance to go to a franchise and win.  JAMES YOUNG:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Like I said, I'm very excited.Ã‚Â\\xa0 He's doing well going to the Lakers, and I feel like I'm going to do well going to the Celtics.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I'm pretty sure we'll cross paths soon.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 On a lighter note, the last time you were here at the Barclays Center, you were sitting next to a lovely recording artist by the name of Rihanna.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Are you going to invite her to one of your Celtic games or invite her when you come to the Barclays Center?  JAMES YOUNG:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Yeah, I mean, of course I will.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Who wouldn't?Ã‚Â\\xa0 If she wants to come, then yeah, I definitely would.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Did you speak with her at all?  JAMES YOUNG:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I got to talk to her a little bit.Ã‚Â\\xa0 She's a cool person, a sweet lady, and I kind of met her at halftime, too.Ã‚Â\\xa0 She's really nice.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Just wanted to talk about what do you think you can bring to the Celtics team?Ã‚Â\\xa0 Have you actually watched the team this upcoming season, too?  JAMES YOUNG:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Yeah, I watched a little bit of them.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Definitely a lot of energy to the team on the offensive side.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Attack the basket and really just put a lot of points on the board.Ã‚Â\\xa0 That's what I'm there for.Ã‚Â\\xa0 So really just be an all around player and look for open guys.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 How did you choose Roc Sports as your agent?Ã‚Â\\xa0 There are a lot of agents out there.  JAMES YOUNG:Ã‚Â\\xa0 They were talking to my dad for a little bit, but when I sat down and talked to them, it was more of a family‑based thing instead of just business.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I'm a big family guy.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Once dad brought that up, he came to me, and I definitely had to go with them.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Going with Jay‑Z but still family based means a lot.  Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 What kind of relationship do you already have with Rajon Rondo, if any?Ã‚Â\\xa0 And how well do you know any of the guys you're about to play with?  JAMES YOUNG:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I haven't really talked to Rajon, and I have a relationship with probably nobody on the team.  Me and Marcus, we roomed together at the Combine a little bit.Ã‚Â\\xa0 So me and him have a little connection.  Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 That being said, what can the guys already on the roster expect from you as a teammate?  JAMES YOUNG:Ã‚Â\\xa0 A guy that's going to be confident, learn from the veteran guys, and definitely just‑‑ definitely, like I said, just learn really, have them show me the ways and just be a part of the team, be a great teammate.  Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Tell me what do you know about Brad Stevens, and also how do you feel about being able to grow with a new coaching staff in Boston as you start your career?  JAMES YOUNG:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Like I said, I don't really know much about the Celtics.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I just got to start doing my research tonight.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Yeah, that's basically it.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 The Celtics just came off a great era with Kevin Garnett, Paul Pierce, Ray Allen.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Now they're forming sort of the next generation with Jared Sullinger and Kelly Olynyk.Ã‚Â\\xa0 How does that feel with the torch being passed to you young guys?  JAMES YOUNG:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Just feel like we got to keep going along with the energy and toughness that Boston has.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Just going along with it.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I feel like we can be a very good team.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I feel like, if we just connect together, we can be real good.  \"}, 'Andrew Wiggins': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=100439', 'text': \"Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Just wondering the significance now of the second No. 1 pick overall in two years coming from Canada and just outside of Toronto.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Can you discuss what that means to the game and the growth of it in your country.  ANDREW WIGGINS:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Pardon me?  Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 If you could speak to the fact we've now had two back‑to‑back No. 1 choices for Toronto.  ANDREW WIGGINS:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Great thing for Toronto.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Great thing for Canada, actually.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Before this, no player from Canada has been No. 1, and now we have two back‑to‑back No. 1s.Ã‚Â\\xa0 So it's a huge accomplishment for Canada.  It just makes‑‑ opens so much more doors for all the kids in Canada, just international basketball by itself, and I'm just looking to playing it for my fellow Canadians, A.B. and Tristan.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Could you talk about today and how nerve‑wracking it was.Ã‚Â\\xa0 When did you find out?Ã‚Â\\xa0 And did you think how long you were going to be the No. 1 pick?  ANDREW WIGGINS:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Today has been busy, busy, busy, a lot of running around, just preparing for this moment.Ã‚Â\\xa0 It all just came so fast.  You know, this time last year, I just graduated from high school.Ã‚Â\\xa0 So this time just came so fast to me.  What was that other question?  Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Did you think you'd be the No. 1 pick all along?  ANDREW WIGGINS:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I always wanted to be the No. 1 pick, but come draft night anything can happen, trades or anything like that.Ã‚Â\\xa0 You never know what to expect.  So when they called my name, I was just all over the place.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Cleveland just recently hired a new coach in David Blatt.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Have you had any discussions with him?Ã‚Â\\xa0 And maybe what do you know about him as a coach?  ANDREW WIGGINS:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I talked to him.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I ran into him when I went to go work out for Cleveland, the facility.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I know he's a great coach, a European coach.  I asked around, no player has never not liked him.Ã‚Â\\xa0 He's a great coach, and I think he's going to do great things for our team and just help us on the come‑up.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Andrew, and you Jabari came into college at the same time.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Now you go 1, 2 in the draft.Ã‚Â\\xa0 You may end up playing the same position, similar regions in the United States now.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Is it inevitable that this may be the beginning of a rivalry or the comparison that you two will be facing each other for quite some time?  ANDREW WIGGINS:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Good players will always be compared to each other, you know, but I never think of anything as a rivalry.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I think that's what the media portrays it to be.  On the court, doesn't matter who I'm going against, I'm going to go hard.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I'm going to go to win and kill.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Off the court we can be friends, but on the court, it's a different story.  I'll never treat one person differently on the court.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Whoever is guarding me, whoever I'm guarding, I'm just going to win.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 You mentioned Tristan and Anthony Bennett.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Talk about the chemistry you have with them and how excited you are to be able to play with them again.  ANDREW WIGGINS:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Well, I played with Tristan for a summer AAU, and I played with Anthony for a while, AAU circuit and the national level, too.Ã‚Â\\xa0 So I'm just excited.Ã‚Â\\xa0 You know, the chemistry is already there with those guys.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I played with them already.Ã‚Â\\xa0 So I think big things are to come.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Hey, Andrew, obviously, it's a big honor to be drafted No. 1.Ã‚Â\\xa0 There's immortality, you're going to be highly compensated.Ã‚Â\\xa0 But don't you wish you could have the right to negotiate with all potential employers in this industry instead of just being limited to one?  ANDREW WIGGINS:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Shoot, I just feel like I can fit in anywhere, whatever team was‑‑  Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Sure, you can.Ã‚Â\\xa0 But don't you wish you had the right to negotiate with all for compensation to see who could give you the best deal instead of have one employer make the best offer?  ANDREW WIGGINS:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I don't really mind it.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Andrew, congratulations.Ã‚Â\\xa0 What does this mean for your family?Ã‚Â\\xa0 In that moment, what did your dad say?Ã‚Â\\xa0 What did your mom say?Ã‚Â\\xa0 What does it mean for you and your brothers and sisters?  ANDREW WIGGINS:Ã‚Â\\xa0 It's a huge moment for me and my family right now, especially because my parents were pro athletes before.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Now they can kind of like live the dream again through me and just watch their youngest son just do something special with his life and play at the highest level of basketball.  So it's a big thing for me and my family.Ã‚Â\\xa0 We cherish moments like this.Ã‚Â\\xa0 So it's great.Ã‚Â\\xa0 It's great for us.  Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 And what did your dad say?Ã‚Â\\xa0 You gave him a big hug, and he gave you a big hug.  ANDREW WIGGINS:Ã‚Â\\xa0 My mom and dad and brothers kept saying how proud they were and they love me, everything like that.Ã‚Â\\xa0 My mind was racing.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Andrew, you've been under the spotlight for a long time, been dealing with a lot of hype and pressure.Ã‚Â\\xa0 How have you been able to stay grounded through that?Ã‚Â\\xa0 And how do you feel it will help you now that you're the No. 1 pick and you'll have it even more?  ANDREW WIGGINS:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I think college really prepares you for a level like this, especially a big‑time basketball school like Kansas or a Duke or a Kentucky, where you're always under the spotlight.Ã‚Â\\xa0 You always have to watch your surroundings and watch what you do.  You're basically treated like a rock star on campus or wherever you go in that state.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I think that really translates to the NBA.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Andrew, obviously, as you know, LeBron James is a free agent this summer.Ã‚Â\\xa0 There's been reports he may want to come back to Cleveland and play on his old team.Ã‚Â\\xa0 If you had to pitch to him why to come back to Cleveland and be your teammate, what would you tell him?  ANDREW WIGGINS:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I want to win.Ã‚Â\\xa0 If he wants to win, we'd be good together.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Andrew, did you hear Joel go third behind you?  ANDREW WIGGINS:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Yeah.  Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 What were your thoughts then, the emotions?  ANDREW WIGGINS:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I was just proud.Ã‚Â\\xa0 It was a proud day.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Me and Jo Jo, we became so close this year at Kansas.Ã‚Â\\xa0 It was so good that I had the chance to really share the journey with somebody that's close to me, you know.  So I'm just proud of him.Ã‚Â\\xa0 He worked so hard.Ã‚Â\\xa0 He didn't let nothing get to him.Ã‚Â\\xa0 He always stays motivated.Ã‚Â\\xa0 So I'm just proud.Ã‚Â\\xa0 It's a proud moment for Kansas.  Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 And I know your time at Kansas meant something to you.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Danny Manning, the last No. 1 pick from KU.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Paul Pierce has been carrying the torch for a while for KU.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Do you feel like you're ready to do that?  ANDREW WIGGINS:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I feel like I'm ready.  Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Andrew, question, I'm feeling that jacket.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Can you tell me the concept behind it?Ã‚Â\\xa0 Who designed it and why?  ANDREW WIGGINS:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Well, this is Waraire Boswell. Ã‚Â\\xa0He customized this suit for me.Ã‚Â\\xa0 But a style by Brandon Williams.  We just wanted to do something really different to just stand out and try to win on both points, stylish points and become No. 1.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 How beneficial has it been to have a father that was in the pros to be able to help you prepare, help you be able to see the game a different way than others?  ANDREW WIGGINS:Ã‚Â\\xa0 It's been really good, really helpful, especially in times if I got down or I need some advice or wisdom or had any questions that needed to be answered.Ã‚Â\\xa0 He was always there for me because he's experienced, he's been there, he's done that.Ã‚Â\\xa0 So he knows right from wrong, and he's always leading me in the right direction.Ã‚Â\\xa0 That's why I lean to him and my mother.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 As Matt mentioned, you're the second No. 1 pick Kansas has ever had and first since Danny Manning in '88.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Can you just talk about what that means to you and what do you think that means to the city of Lawrence and the university?  ANDREW WIGGINS:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I think it's big time, you know, just making history.Ã‚Â\\xa0 The Kansas fans, they all just supported me throughout anything, a bad game, a good game.Ã‚Â\\xa0 They were always loyal fans.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Kansas has the best fans in the world to me, just how crazy it is, the atmosphere in Allen Fieldhouse.  I know this is a proud moment for me and Jo Jo.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I know they're proud of us, too.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Andrew, some outlets list you as a small forward, some show you as a shooting guard.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Any sense of which of those positions you feel is going to be the place for you on the next level?  ANDREW WIGGINS:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I think I can play both.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I think I'm tall enough and skilled enough to play the two or three.  Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Do you have a preference?  ANDREW WIGGINS:Ã‚Â\\xa0 No.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Whatever the coach wants me to play, I'll play.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Hockey's obviously the big sport in Canada.Ã‚Â\\xa0 What do you think this does now having two No. 1 picks back to back?Ã‚Â\\xa0 What do you think this does for basketball in Canada as a whole?  ANDREW WIGGINS:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I think it's huge.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Like I said before, it opens doors for all the youth and everyone in Canada.Ã‚Â\\xa0 It gives them hope, you know, because coming up when I was in Canada, I wasn't ranked or nothing.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I wasn't known.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I didn't have no offers or anything like that.  But I just kept my head straight and kept working on my game and look where I am today.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I just think it gives everyone in Canada hope that they can accomplish what I do because it's possible if they work hard.  \"}, 'T.J.

NOAH VONLEH:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I think it can definitely complement those guys, playing in the pick‑and‑roll with Kemba, being able to pop, hit the shot from 18 feet, step out, hit some NBA threes, catch the ball, be able to take guys off the dribble, and just use my versatility to the best of my abilities.

I think now that I\\'m there in Charlotte with him, we\\'ll definitely have a better relationship.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 You\\'re still only 18 years old.Ã‚Â\\xa0 What made you so NBA ready at such a young age?

Ã‚Â\\xa0Nik, if you could just start opening statements, feelings about getting drafted.  NIK STAUSKAS:Ã‚Â\\xa0 This is a huge honor for me.Ã‚Â\\xa0 This is something I've been working towards since I was 7 years old.Ã‚Â\\xa0 The fact that I'm sitting here in front of all you guys now is just‑‑ I can't put this into words.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I'm excited to be a member of the Sacramento Kings.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I've only heard good things about the city and the organization.Ã‚Â\\xa0 So I'm excited to get to work and help this team win.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Nik, congratulations.Ã‚Â\\xa0 In your wildest dreams until maybe a few weeks ago, did you think you'd be a No.8 pick in the NBA Draft?Ã‚Â\\xa0 How do you feel about that?  NIK STAUSKAS:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I always believed it.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I believed in myself, and I don't think many other people did, but this is something I always felt is a possibility for me, and I just kept working my hardest to make it happen.  It sounds‑‑ it's a cliche, but dreams really do come true when you put all your effort into it.Ã‚Â\\xa0 So I'm just glad Sacramento picked me, and I'm not going to let them down.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Nik, congrats.Ã‚Â\\xa0 How much of the Kings have you watched?Ã‚Â\\xa0 And how do you feel like you fit in with their personnel?  NIK STAUSKAS:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I haven't really watched a lot of their other games, but I know they got a strong young core.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I know they got DeMarcus Cousins, Isaiah Thomas, Ben McLemore, Rudy Gay, a lot of strong players on the team.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I know they struggled with shooting the basketball in the past.  Immediately, I think I can be a guy that comes in and helps stretch the floor and knock down shots for them.Ã‚Â\\xa0 So I'm excited to do that.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Nik, I wanted to ask you, talk about coming up with the University of Michigan with topnotch players like Trey Burke and Glenn Robinson, Mitch McGary, Tim Hardaway Jr.Ã‚Â\\xa0 How was that motivating for you to build your game up?  NIK STAUSKAS:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Playing with guys like Trey and Tim my freshman year, it helped me a lot because I saw the level of commitment and the talent and the work ethic and everything that they put forth.Ã‚Â\\xa0 To see them this year have all that success in the NBA just made me confident in myself because I know I can do what they did.  So it helped a lot playing with them, and I learned a lot from them my first year with them.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Nik, you played at St. Mark's in high school, not a lot of people know that, with another NBA player, Erik Murphy of the Utah Jazz.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Have you talked to him?Ã‚Â\\xa0 Have you picked his brain at all about what your first season in the NBA might be like?  NIK STAUSKAS:Ã‚Â\\xa0 No, actually, I don't‑‑ I haven't been in contact with Erik.Ã‚Â\\xa0 So I haven't really talked to him about that.  Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Nik, what has been the biggest key during your time at Michigan to turn what you said was a dream into something that's now a reality?  NIK STAUSKAS:Ã‚Â\\xa0 The biggest what?  Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 The biggest key of what you gained at Michigan.  NIK STAUSKAS:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I think over my‑‑ over the summer coming into my sophomore year, I added a lot of strength and speed and athleticism, which helped me kind of be more versatile this year.Ã‚Â\\xa0 At the same time, I feel like I've just made a lot of strides on my mental game and just being more confident in myself and believing in myself, you know, even when things aren't going my way.  I think those are the two biggest keys for me, as well as Coach Beilein and the rest of the coaching staff there, they did a phenomenal job of putting me in the right spots and the right positions to be successful.  Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 When you were deciding on a college, how much did NBA prep play into your decision?  NIK STAUSKAS:Ã‚Â\\xa0 When I decided to go to Michigan, the thing that was really attractive was I thought I could play right away, and I thought I could play on a very good team.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Any time in college basketball when you're playing a big role on a good team, you're going to have a chance to get to that next level.Ã‚Â\\xa0 So that's all I could ask for.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 So Andrew went 1, and you came off the board a little bit later.Ã‚Â\\xa0 How much does that mean for Canada and your country?Ã‚Â\\xa0 Have you and Andrew talked about it at all?Ã‚Â\\xa0 How much does it mean to you guys representing your country?  NIK STAUSKAS:Ã‚Â\\xa0 It means a lot.Ã‚Â\\xa0 It means a lot to us, for sure.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I talked with Andrew the last couple of days, just being here in New York at the same time.  We're very excited for the future of Canada basketball.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I feel like, if we really all commit to coming in and working hard and coming together, I think we could have a really good team.  I'm not saying we're going to win a gold medal right now, but I'm saying that we could have a chance to compete at that level if we really‑‑ if we all commit to it.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Nik, congratulations, amazing.Ã‚Â\\xa0 What was that little thing with your dad?Ã‚Â\\xa0 Can you explain and take us through it blow by blow, please.  NIK STAUSKAS:Ã‚Â\\xa0 It was planned.Ã‚Â\\xa0 A planned handshake that we thought of last night.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I always just throw up the three goggles.Ã‚Â\\xa0 So I thought it was only appropriate I did it here.  Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Were you worried about your dad being able to execute under pressure?  NIK STAUSKAS:Ã‚Â\\xa0 A little bit, yeah.Ã‚Â\\xa0 It was a little pressure, but he got it right.Ã‚Â\\xa0 So I'm happy.  Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Nik, Michigan is a very good school academically, great campus like Zingerman's, the art festival in Ann Arbor.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Was it an easy decision?Ã‚Â\\xa0 There must be a tough decision to say, I want to leave early, because it is a great school.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Was there part of you that said, I should get my degree here and then go to the NBA?  NIK STAUSKAS:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I definitely thought about it, but the biggest thing for me after this season was I felt like I was ready.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I thought I had improved enough throughout the year, and I had made a lot of strides in my game and made the necessary improvements to make that jump to the next level.  Like I said, this has been a dream of mine my entire life.Ã‚Â\\xa0 The fact that I had the opportunity to do it now, I feel like this is the right time.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I understand that I could always go back and get my education after, which I fully plan on doing.  \"}, 'Marcus Smart': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=100443', 'text': \"Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Marcus, given that the Celtics already have a player in Rajon Rondo, how do you feel you can work with him and the team going forward?  MARCUS SMART:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Definitely.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Rondo is a wonderful point guard, a wonderful player.Ã‚Â\\xa0 He reminds me a little bit of me.Ã‚Â\\xa0 He plays defense.Ã‚Â\\xa0 He's long, his wing span, and he has big hands.  Just being able to learn from a guy who's been in the league and been in my seat and my situation, it's an amazing feeling and a great opportunity.  Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Are you a little disappointed that you weren't picked by a team where you'd start right away maybe?  MARCUS SMART:Ã‚Â\\xa0 No, not at all.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I understand that you got to come in, you've got to earn your spot and earn your keep.Ã‚Â\\xa0 That's who I am.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I like to earn things, and I work hard to get where I'm at.Ã‚Â\\xa0 That's what I'm going to continue doing.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 How much are you looking forward to playing for Brad Stevens?  MARCUS SMART:Ã‚Â\\xa0 It's going to be an interesting season.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Brad's a great coach, and I had a lot of time talking with him.Ã‚Â\\xa0 So I'm looking forward to playing for him and learning and taking it all in.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Marcus, first of all, did you have a sense that Boston was leaning your way?Ã‚Â\\xa0 You didn't seem like that was a team that was dialing in on you.  MARCUS SMART:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Actually, I did.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I worked out for Boston twice.Ã‚Â\\xa0 So I've talked with Danny Ainge and Coach Stevens a lot.  They told me they were very interested in me, and if I was still on the board, there's a chance they might pick me.Ã‚Â\\xa0 So now I'm here repping green.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Marcus, what do you bring to the Celtics now?Ã‚Â\\xa0 How did you change your game during your sophomore year at Oklahoma State?  MARCUS SMART:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I've done a lot of things.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I've been working on my shot a little bit more to become a more consistent shooter during my sophomore season and the summertime this time.  I just bring that competitive nature that Boston already has, that toughness they already have.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I just continue to bring it and keep that fire going.  Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I know you played a lot of different positions at Oklahoma State.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Can you play the two?Ã‚Â\\xa0 Is that something you'd be comfortable with?  MARCUS SMART:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Definitely, no doubt.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I think me being so versatile in college helped me to be able to play the two or one or whatever position the Celtics want me to play at the next level.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 You talked about working out twice with the Celtics in Waltham.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Was there anything, when you got there, did you look up and see the banners and realize that, wow, the rich history of the organization?Ã‚Â\\xa0 Did that sit in when you were there?  MARCUS SMART:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Definitely.Ã‚Â\\xa0 They had actually a video playing in the locker room.Ã‚Â\\xa0 We got done working out, and it just kept replaying and replaying and replaying over and over.Ã‚Â\\xa0 It was just talking about the history and the guys that's been through there and the work, the blood, the sweat and tears they put into that program.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Talk about schematically what do you know about the Celtics and how you can be able to fit your skill set within your scheme.  MARCUS SMART:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I know everybody knows the Celtics are a championship caliber type of program.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Everybody knows what you're going to get out of the Celtics.Ã‚Â\\xa0 They're going to compete every day, and that's who I am.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I'm going to compete every day and work hard.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I covered you last year for the USA Basketball.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Can you just talk about the competitiveness of already playing against NBA players and how it can contribute for this season to the Celtics.  MARCUS SMART:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Definitely.Ã‚Â\\xa0 That was a little advantage I had over a lot of college players.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I was able to play against the highest level guys here, the Kyrie Irvings, the John Walls and all those guys, and get a preference and a sense of what's to come.  So kind of already having that experience is going to help me in the long run.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Kind of going off that, kind of stole a bit of my thunder there, but do you think you are NBA ready?Ã‚Â\\xa0 Do you think you can step in and compete at the NBA level?Ã‚Â\\xa0 A lot of people say you are at that point, draft and NBA ready.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Do you believe you are NBA ready?  MARCUS SMART:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Definitely.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I like to think I have an NBA‑ready body.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I have a good basketball IQ.Ã‚Â\\xa0 And I know how to play with guys and teammates.  So I'm a great team player, and I like to win.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I like to think I'm an NBA ready person.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Marcus, two things, this last year, having going through everything you went through, just even staying in school and doing that, how much did that help you for this?Ã‚Â\\xa0 Secondly, just what's it going to be like?Ã‚Â\\xa0 You kind of lived your life in one area of the country, and now it's going to be a bit of a move.  MARCUS SMART:Ã‚Â\\xa0 To answer your first question, I was able to learn a lot of things.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I've been through a lot of adversity my first two years of college, and it helped me because it was the lessons that I was taught that helped me prepare for the NBA and prepare for life in general.  To answer your second question, yeah, it's going to be a little bit weird, but I'm open for new things and new challenges.Ã‚Â\\xa0 So I'm ready to get started.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Two questions for you as well:Ã‚Â\\xa0 How much of the Celtics did you watch last season?Ã‚Â\\xa0 And aside from Rondo, how do you see yourself playing alongside the other guys on the team?  MARCUS SMART:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I watched them a little bit.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Majority of the season, they didn't really have Rondo.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Avery Bradley stepped in a little bit.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Phil Pressey played a little bit.  Like I said, I'm a competitor.Ã‚Â\\xa0 So I'm willing to do whatever it takes and play with whoever I have to play with.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I'm just happy to be here and happy to have the opportunity.  Thank you, guys.  \"}, 'Dario Saric': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=100457', 'text': 'Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Talk about the fact that you couldn\\'t wait to sign your contract.Ã‚Â\\xa0 You had to sign it before the Draft with your team.  DARIO SARIC:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Yeah, I sign before the Draft because I\\'m choosing a better option for me to stay two years more in Europe to get more experience, to bring my basketball to another level. I don\\'t know.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I\\'m choosing before the Draft because I don\\'t know if someone in Philadelphia choose me because he know I\\'m no liar, and one day I\\'ll be back in Philadelphia for sure.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Dario, enlighten us on‑‑ like I don\\'t know much about your game, but talk about what are your strengths, and when you get to the NBA, how those strengths will be magnified.  DARIO SARIC:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I think a player like‑‑ all around player like Lamar Odom, Toni Kukoc.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I got good ball handling for 6\\'10\".Ã‚Â\\xa0 I see myself in Philadelphia because Philadelphia got two athletic, big guys, got smart playmaker, and I think I can and this team can improve to bring another level to deeper level.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Dario, you mentioned that you want to work on your game overseas.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Why do you feel working on it overseas as opposed to coming to the NBA now and working on those aspects of your game in the NBA is a better decision for you?  DARIO SARIC:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I think I was starting to play basketball step by step.Ã‚Â\\xa0 When I was 15, 14, I was playing for third league of Croatia.Ã‚Â\\xa0 After that, I was playing two league of Croatia, after first league of Croatia, and after that I played like two years in Adriatic League.Ã‚Â\\xa0 For me, it\\'s normally next step is one or two years in Europe in Euroleague, and after that, like NBA.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Dario, have you, being in Croatia and overseas, have you had any experience watching the Sixers?  DARIO SARIC:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Yeah, I know everything about the Sixers, Moses Malone, Charles Barkley, Allen Iverson, and I love the team.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I know it\\'s like fifth town in the USA, and I know everything about Philadelphia. Ã‚Â\\xa0Philadelphia, again, they are like most faster team in the NBA right now.  I really want to come here in Philadelphia to put my gameon that team after two years.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 When you were with the teams that you played over there in Croatia, were they championship contenders?  DARIO SARIC:Ã‚Â\\xa0 We won the Adriatic League.Ã‚Â\\xa0 For me, it\\'s better than college basketball.Ã‚Â\\xa0 The guys from that league, they have more experience than the college guy.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I think Adriatic League is better league than college basketball.  Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 You named some of those Philadelphia 76ers players.Ã‚Â\\xa0 That\\'s when the Philadelphia 76ers were a very good team.Ã‚Â\\xa0 That\\'s not quite the way it is these days.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I hope it won\\'t be a disappointment to kind of have to start at the bottom there.  DARIO SARIC:Ã‚Â\\xa0 We\\'ll see.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I don\\'t know.Ã‚Â\\xa0 We\\'ll see about that.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 How does it feel being drafted now?Ã‚Â\\xa0 Finally being able to come to the NBA after talking about it for so many years.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Last year you almost came in.Ã‚Â\\xa0 How does it feel now to be drafted?  DARIO SARIC: Ã‚Â\\xa0I feel very happy, like first time in my life I feel like now I know what it means to my family in Croatia and my friends, everybody is happy for me.Ã‚Â\\xa0 This is big part, big time in my basketball career and my life.  I really want to be a Philadelphia 76er.  Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Is there any chance you could come into the NBA next year, or will it definitely be two years?  DARIO SARIC:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I think we can talk about that with Turkey team after the next season.Ã‚Â\\xa0 If a chance to be, I will come here to 76ers of Philadelphia.  Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Dario, obviously, you know a lot about the Sixers history.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Yesterday you were telling me about how your father introduced you to Magic Johnson.Ã‚Â\\xa0 How did you learn so much about the NBA growing up?  DARIO SARIC:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I think you asked me about how NBA growing up for teams‑‑  Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Yeah, in Croatia, how did you learn so much about the history of the 76ers?  DARIO SARIC:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I learned so much like things like we have‑‑ like you have in America newspaper, Google, internet, things like that.Ã‚Â\\xa0 We share NBA, my friends and I, we love so much to playing PlayStation 4 and NBA, and we know so much about Philadelphia, Iguodala, and so much guys from Philadelphia.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I know everything.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 You mentioned Toni Kukoc earlier.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Was that someone you grew up admiring?Ã‚Â\\xa0 Who else did you admire watching on the basketball court?  DARIO SARIC:Ã‚Â\\xa0 You asked me like‑‑ can you repeat?  Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 You mentioned Toni Kukoc before, who\\'s from the same country you are from.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Did you grow up idolizing him?Ã‚Â\\xa0 And who else did you grow up watching?  DARIO SARIC:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I don\\'t have any like idols.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I can say my favorite player is Magic Johnson.Ã‚Â\\xa0 And Drazen Petrovic is from same hometown like me from Sibenik, and this is is my idol for basketball.Ã‚Â\\xa0 He got same mentality of practicing and working basketball.  I love Magic Johnson, how he played.  '}, 'Julius Randle': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=100444', 'text': \"Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 You mentioned Kobe, what's it going to be like now being able to learn from him and compete alongside of him?  JULIUS RANDLE:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I'm going to learn a lot.Ã‚Â\\xa0 He may get tired of me because I'm going to be bugging him learning, trying to learn stuff from him.Ã‚Â\\xa0 So I'm going to learn a lot from him.  But I think it's more than him.Ã‚Â\\xa0 He was blessed to be in an organization like the Lakers as well.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Talent alone, his work ethic alone got him there, but I think the Lakers was the right fit, the right organization for me to go to.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Kobe Bryant is known to kind of demand a lot from his teammates.  JULIUS RANDLE:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Yeah.  Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Are you ready for that kind of commitment, and what are you going to bring to the Lakers?Ã‚Â\\xa0 They have a lot of empty spots.  JULIUS RANDLE:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I demand a lot from my teammates as well, holding each other accountable, putting extra work in was what I had to do at Kentucky.Ã‚Â\\xa0 It was what I demanded of my teammates, and that's what we did, and that's why we were successful.  I think I bring a lot to the Lakers as far as a skill set being able to shoot the ball, handle the ball, of course my post‑game.Ã‚Â\\xa0 But I think I bring a lot to L.A. for sure.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Talk more about your post game and how that can be an advantage with the lack of post play going on in the league right now?  JULIUS RANDLE:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I think it can be a huge advantage.Ã‚Â\\xa0 A lot of the league is going to small ball, but the good thing about me, I'm interchangeable.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I can play small ball because I can guard multiple positions because I really can move.  But you know, I think it's going to be an advantage for me to be able to take a smaller guy inside but also take a bigger guy on the outside.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 It's certainly an honor to be drafted by any of these franchises, being in Los Angeles with the endorsements it brings, did that cross your mind?Ã‚Â\\xa0 Is that something your agent spoke about, even informally?Ã‚Â\\xa0 It seems like you're natural for that market.  JULIUS RANDLE:Ã‚Â\\xa0 It may be a national market.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I'm not worried about endorsements though.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Lakers, that's about championships.Ã‚Â\\xa0 That's what I want to bring.  I'm nothing other than a winner.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I think that's my biggest attribute and my biggest quality I can bring to a team.Ã‚Â\\xa0 The endorsements and all that stuff will come with it.  Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 We'll get there.  JULIUS RANDLE:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I'm not worried about it.  Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 There was sort of an eruption there with you and your family at the table.Ã‚Â\\xa0 What was that moment like?Ã‚Â\\xa0 I know you have been waiting a long time.  JULIUS RANDLE:Ã‚Â\\xa0 We're just ecstatic.Ã‚Â\\xa0 All the hard work that's been put in, and for this to finally happen, what can I really say?  I'm blessed to be in an organization like this.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Really just speechless, honestly.  Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 What did she say to you?  JULIUS RANDLE:Ã‚Â\\xa0 She was just happy.Ã‚Â\\xa0 She couldn't really say anything.Ã‚Â\\xa0 She was just screaming.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 There was a report that came out about your foot and that it might have required surgery.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Obviously, turned out not to be true.Ã‚Â\\xa0 You refuted it from the very start.Ã‚Â\\xa0 How is it a balance, though, if you would have been drafted higher, you go to a worse team, but you get drafted lower and you end up with an organization like the Lakers.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Sort of what's the balance there?  JULIUS RANDLE:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I mean, it's sort of a balance, I guess.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I really wasn't worried about it.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Whatever organization or team I went to, I would be blessed to go to.Ã‚Â\\xa0 That's where God wanted me to be.Ã‚Â\\xa0 But happily, it's in L.A.  Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Are you fully healthy now?Ã‚Â\\xa0 Do you expect to be able to play in Summer League for the Lakers?  JULIUS RANDLE:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I expect to, but different doctors have different opinions.Ã‚Â\\xa0 So you really never know.Ã‚Â\\xa0 But as far as the start of the season, that's what I'm worried about.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I mean, I'll be there.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Julius, you're obviously working toward this since getting to Kentucky.Ã‚Â\\xa0 How do you think it prepared you for this?  JULIUS RANDLE:Ã‚Â\\xa0 It prepared me for a lot.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Kentucky's basketball is the only thing Kentucky knows.Ã‚Â\\xa0 We have horse racing and stuff, but they care about basketball.  When you have a place that sells out 24,000 a game, name another place that does that.Ã‚Â\\xa0 L.A., what do they care about?Ã‚Â\\xa0 They don't have a football team.Ã‚Â\\xa0 They have hockey, the Kings, or whatever, but L.A., they won a championship.Ã‚Â\\xa0 The Lakers‑‑ when you think of L.A., you think of the Lakers.Ã‚Â\\xa0 That is no disrespect to the hockey team.Ã‚Â\\xa0 You just won a Stanley Cup.Ã‚Â\\xa0 That's pretty ridiculous.Ã‚Â\\xa0 That's pretty ridiculous.Ã‚Â\\xa0 A Stanley Cup is ridiculous.Ã‚Â\\xa0 So congrats to them.  But the city of L.A., you got Magic, all those guys, Kobe, that's what you think of.Ã‚Â\\xa0 You think of the Lakers, and that's what I'm really excited to go to.  Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Julius, congratulations.Ã‚Â\\xa0 You were in this building 14 months ago playing in the Jordan Brand Classic.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Compare and contrast your feelings being a high school student playing here and now being selected for the NBA Draft.  JULIUS RANDLE:Ã‚Â\\xa0 It's an amazing feeling.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I also had a game here in Barclays when I played versus Providence.Ã‚Â\\xa0 So it's a totally different feeling, three different events, and luckily each time it's been a really good time here.  This draft has been really good for me as well.  Thank you.  \"}, 'Elfrid Payton': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=100447', 'text': \"Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 All right, Jason.Ã‚Â\\xa0 You told me Allen Iverson is your favorite player.Ã‚Â\\xa0 How does it feel to go to his team?  ELFRID PAYTON:Ã‚Â\\xa0 It feels great.Ã‚Â\\xa0 He was my favorite player of all time.Ã‚Â\\xa0 So it's amazing.  Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Elfrid, you're a point guard.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Michael Carter‑Williams is a point guard.Ã‚Â\\xa0 How do you see you guys fitting together?  ELFRID PAYTON:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I think the game is kind of changing into putting the best players on the floor, and I feel like I can play multiple positions.Ã‚Â\\xa0 So I'm looking forward to it.  Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Elfrid, congratulations.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Talk about your emphasis on defense and your overall skill set in being able to rebound and pass.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Talk about how that can help you get a lot of minutes early and be able to gain a lot of experience at the pro level.  ELFRID PAYTON:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I think my defense is going to get me on the court.Ã‚Â\\xa0 All coaches sure love defense because that's what wins championships.  Once I get on the floor, I can show them maybe my passing, and like you said, things like that, and my rebounding ability.Ã‚Â\\xa0 And that it will be a great experience.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 You kind of just talked about it, but can you just talk about what you can bring to the Philadelphia 76ers and also how much you watched them last year.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Obviously, they had a historically bad season.  ELFRID PAYTON:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I think I could just bring my defense and my leadership abilities.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I know a lot of guys are probably not going to listen to me, being a rookie, so just try to lead by example, things like that.  I didn't watch much of the games last year, but I'll be excited to be there, man.  Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Are you looking forward to being able to go through this experience with another rookie in Joel Embiid?Ã‚Â\\xa0 And are you looking forward to being able to play with him on the court?  ELFRID PAYTON:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Yes, I am looking forward to playing with him.Ã‚Â\\xa0 He's a great big man with a tremendous talent.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Point guards love big men.Ã‚Â\\xa0 So I think it's going to be great.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 There's reports you're going to be traded to the Orlando Magic.Ã‚Â\\xa0 How does it feel to go to Orlando?  ELFRID PAYTON:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I mean, I don't know.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I guess that would be nice, too.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Anything is a blessing, man.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 It does kind of bring an interesting point with the different cities.Ã‚Â\\xa0 You're from a small town.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Was there part of you that says, are you more comfortable with a bigger market versus a smaller market?  ELFRID PAYTON:Ã‚Â\\xa0 No, it wouldn't matter.Ã‚Â\\xa0 It wouldn't matter.  Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Philadelphia is a great town, history, I know something about the place.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Very sports obsessed, though, maniacally sports obsessed.Ã‚Â\\xa0 They take it pretty seriously.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Just was curious what your thoughts are on the town.

ADREIAN PAYNE:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Can you clear that up a little bit?  Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 What I was saying was can you tell me the preparation for your outfit, what goes into that?  ADREIAN PAYNE:Ã‚Â\\xa0 It really has a meaning behind it.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I wore this for the‑‑ dedicated to Lacey Holsworth, and it's the color of her cancer that she had, leukemia, and I wear a band every day.Ã‚Â\\xa0 As you can see, the band is the same color as the suit.  So that's why I wore it and that's where I got my inspiration from.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Adreian, the Hawks are a team that love to have their bigs spread out based on the floor.Ã‚Â\\xa0 That seems like it would be a great fit for you.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Are you excited to get out there in an offense that gets you out there spacing around the arc?  ADREIAN PAYNE:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Yeah, I'm very excited that I can continue to play my game and stretch the floor and play inside and out.  Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Adreian, first of all, congratulations.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Paul Millsap, Al Horford, Kyle Korver, Jeff Teague, those are some pretty good guys.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Are you ready to compete at that level?

Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 So I was here in November when you scored 29 points against Virginia Tech way back at one of the tip‑off tournaments.Ã‚Â\\xa0 So tell me what this year has been like for you.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Obviously, you mentioned Lacey, which is a big part of what you've been about.Ã‚Â\\xa0 What's changed since then, and what's the same?  ADREIAN PAYNE:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Really, everything's the same.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I have got better as a person, better patience, and have got stronger from it, just from losing close people in my life.

ADREIAN PAYNE:Ã‚Â\\xa0 No, not at all.Ã‚Â\\xa0 We're both teammates, and we're very close friends.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I look at him like a little brother, and he looks at me like a brother.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I wish I could be out there to see where he went and be out there to support him.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Eventually, once this is over with, you know, we're going to talk and continue to share wisdom and just talk.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 We talked yesterday about Tom Izzo, the highest paid public employee in the state of Michigan.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Has he called you and let you know that you can outearn him next year?  ADREIAN PAYNE:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Yeah, we always talk.Ã‚Â\\xa0 He's a great guy.Ã‚Â\\xa0 He's always giving me information so I can get better.  Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Are you going to mention your compensation will dwarf his next year?  ADREIAN PAYNE:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Like I said, they're going to be a great team, and he's a great coach.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I'm looking forward to seeing them get into the tournament.  Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 You grew up in the Midwest.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Is this kind of the excitement tonight, leaving the Midwest? ADREIAN PAYNE:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I'm leaving the Midwest, but it's always going to be a part of me.  Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 What are you going to bring from Michigan State to Atlanta?  ADREIAN PAYNE:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Like I said, from Michigan State, we have a toughness, the players that leave there, and I'm going to just bring toughness, hard work, and I'm going to play hard every game and in practice.  Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Adreian, you talked about the competitiveness of the Hawks.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Talk about schematically the Spurs system, with Coach Mike Budenholzer.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Talk about how your skill set could fit in that.  ADREIAN PAYNE:Ã‚Â\\xa0 It's definitely going to help, playing into my strengths, just being able to be team oriented and not just relying on one guy to go out and do everything as a team‑oriented game.Ã‚Â\\xa0 It's not just offense, it's definitely defense.  And defense like at Michigan State, coaches always say defense wins championships.  Thank you.  \"}, 'Jabari Parker': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=100440', 'text': \"Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Jabari, you said yesterday you thought you were going with the Bucks, and how did you know?Ã‚Â\\xa0 What does it feel like that it really came true?  JABARI PARKER:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I was just going off what I was given.Ã‚Â\\xa0 They told me that they're all in.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I can't go in with any accusations of teams not telling me anything.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I just went from what was more accurate.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 How much of the Bucks have you watched?Ã‚Â\\xa0 And how do you feel you fit in with their personnel?  JABARI PARKER:Ã‚Â\\xa0 They're a young team.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I feel like I can contribute right off the bat.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I feel like I'm going to be able to grow with that organization, and I'm trying to be a throwback player, only stick with one team.  This might bite me in the butt years from now, but right now I just want to stick with whoever's rolling with me.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Jabari, first of all, congratulations.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Talk about what you'll bring to the Milwaukee Bucks.Ã‚Â\\xa0 What do you think you can bring day one, year one?  JABARI PARKER:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I'm going to bring everything I got.Ã‚Â\\xa0 You know, you ain't got to ask for anything else.Ã‚Â\\xa0 When I said that I was committed to going to Duke, I gave them everything I had, and even with my high school.Ã‚Â\\xa0 So I'm going to try to do the same thing with Milwaukee.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 It would have been nice to go No. 1.Ã‚Â\\xa0 The fact that you're from Chicago, which is only 81 miles from Milwaukee, is there kind of a part of you that was kind of hoping this isn't such a bad deal?Ã‚Â\\xa0 Have the family come up on the Amtrak and see you whenever they want.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Was that part of your thinking in this process?  JABARI PARKER:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I'm just very optimistic.Ã‚Â\\xa0 If it was 1, 2, put me at 60, just getting that opportunity, getting that chance of being in the NBA.  Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 But the proximity being near home.Ã‚Â\\xa0 That's kind of the point I'm making.  JABARI PARKER:Ã‚Â\\xa0 That really speaks for itself, too.Ã‚Â\\xa0 It's not really a long drive.Ã‚Â\\xa0 My parents can easily access me, and also I get to enjoy that Great Lake water again.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 How excited are you at the prospect, new ownership, new arena, and you're basically the face of a new era of Milwaukee Bucks basketball that really you look at franchise, going back to Jabbar, Ray Allen in the '90s, they had a lot of success.  JABARI PARKER:Ã‚Â\\xa0 They really did have a lot of success, especially in the days with Lew Alcindor.Ã‚Â\\xa0 In the '90s when they made the playoffs with Sam Cassell.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I just want to be remembered as one of them, too, since I'm going to the Bucks.  Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 With you going No.2 and Andrew going No. 1, inevitably there's going to be a comparison, a rivalry there.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Have you talked about it going up to the Draft?Ã‚Â\\xa0 And how do you embrace that dynamic going forward and that comparison happening and how you guys will be the faces of franchises heading in there?  JABARI PARKER:Ã‚Â\\xa0 It's not my job to compare.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I'm going to leave it to y'all.Ã‚Â\\xa0 It's your duty and your job to stir up controversy, and y'all keep it, you know.  Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Did you feel any competitiveness to try to go No. 1, to try and beat Wiggins for that spot?  JABARI PARKER:Ã‚Â\\xa0 No.Ã‚Â\\xa0 What does the draft really give entitlement to, the best player?Ã‚Â\\xa0 You got Doug McDermott scoring 3,000 points.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Shoot, you got Julius Randle went to the National Championship.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Shabazz Napier won two National Championships.  I mean, we're all good.Ã‚Â\\xa0 We're all great players.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 And did you have a chance to talk to Andrew coming into this room?Ã‚Â\\xa0 Did you guys cross paths with each other?Ã‚Â\\xa0 Any good wishes or anything coming in?  JABARI PARKER:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Most definitely.Ã‚Â\\xa0 You always want to wish good on people.Ã‚Â\\xa0 We don't take a good enough job embracing each other and uplifting each other, and Andrew's going to do a real good job being a Cavalier, and he also has the opportunity to be amongst his fellow Canadian teammates.  Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Jabari, what do you feel as far as small forward, power forward, some talk that you might be able to play some power forward for the Bucks as well?Ã‚Â\\xa0 With Giannis there, how do you see that fit with the Bucks?Ã‚Â\\xa0 I think yesterday you said you could play either one.  JABARI PARKER:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Yeah, I'm just trying to continue that role that I was given by Coach K, just being a complete basketball player, whether they want me at the two, the one, the five, being able to fit in all slots and being able to contribute in the best ways.  Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 What about playing with Giannis?  JABARI PARKER:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Giannis is very young.Ã‚Â\\xa0 He's a year older than me.Ã‚Â\\xa0 We get a chance to grow together.  \"}, 'Jusuf Nurkic': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=100460', 'text': 'Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Are you going to play in the NBA next season?

SHABAZZ NAPIER:Ã‚Â\\xa0 The first thing that jumps off is the winning attitude.Ã‚Â\\xa0 That's one of the biggest things.Ã‚Â\\xa0 When you compete at that high level, you want to win every single game.Ã‚Â\\xa0 That winning attitude comes in the first day you arrive at that camp.Ã‚Â\\xa0 On the first day you arrive to that organization, you want to work, and you want to prove that you can get back there.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Not prove to anybody, but to yourself, to your teammates that you can get back there.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Shabazz, a lot of reports that LeBron wanted you to be the guy the Heat picked.Ã‚Â\\xa0 What's your relationship with LeBron?Ã‚Â\\xa0 And are you bringing him back to South Beach with you?  SHABAZZ NAPIER:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I don't know if I'm bringing him back.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I would love it.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Me and LeBron's relationship, he's a great guy.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I've been to his camps.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Me and him chatted a few times at his camps.Ã‚Â\\xa0 He's just a special thing.  My agent just told me that he Tweeted something out about me just now.Ã‚Â\\xa0 It's just something special to know that one of the best players in the world thinks about you and appreciates your talent.Ã‚Â\\xa0 That's something that I'm so humble for.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Shabazz, it's been a long time coming, man.Ã‚Â\\xa0 It feels like yesterday you were playing at Charlestown High School.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Talk about what it's like to be able to go into an organization, a championship organization, that has a need right away at the point guard position and to be able to learn from the best player in the NBA.  SHABAZZ NAPIER:Ã‚Â\\xa0 It's just, to sum it up, it's just a blessing, man.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I would be lying to you guys if I said I thought I would be here when I was high school.Ã‚Â\\xa0 It's just truly a blessing.  It's just‑‑ it's one of those experiences you really can't describe.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Like I said, I'm so happy I was able to do it with my family, and that's one of the biggest things.  Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Right.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Was there ever a moment like, whether you were in college, where you realized like, I can really make this thing happen?  SHABAZZ NAPIER:Ã‚Â\\xa0 You know, everyone asks me that, and I'm not sure.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Maybe when I was a sophomore.Ã‚Â\\xa0 You know, even when I was a freshman, of course, NBA was something I watched, but sometimes your aspirations are left at that.  I had to work hard.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I had to tell myself that this is not going to be easy to get to where I am now.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I'm pretty sure that everything came in my sophomore year.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Mario Chalmers is a free agent, and Norris Cole didn't have such a great postseason.Ã‚Â\\xa0 So it's possible that you could slide in as the starting point guard for the Miami Heat.Ã‚Â\\xa0 How do you feel about that?  SHABAZZ NAPIER:Ã‚Â\\xa0 There's always opportunity to do something great, and no matter if I was going to slide in as a starter or come off the bench, I'm still going to work hard.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I'm going to compete.Ã‚Â\\xa0 That's who I am.  My attitude will never change if a head coach was telling me I was going to start right away.Ã‚Â\\xa0 It's going to be the same way.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I'm going to work as if I'm not on the team.Ã‚Â\\xa0 That's what brought me in, and that's what's going to make me as good as I want to be.  Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Were you in contact with the Heat prior to the draft?  SHABAZZ NAPIER:Ã‚Â\\xa0 No.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I was in contact with my family.Ã‚Â\\xa0 That's about it.  Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Shabazz, I'm not sure‑‑ we just found out today that 50 percent of your bloodline is Puerto Rican.  SHABAZZ NAPIER:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Yeah.  Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 The whole island of Puerto Rico has your back right now and are huge fans of the Miami Heat.Ã‚Â\\xa0 What are your thoughts now knowing that you have the whole island on your back right now?  SHABAZZ NAPIER:Ã‚Â\\xa0 So I was raised by my mom, and my mom's full Puerto Rican.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I kind of think I'm 75 percent.  I actually went out there my sophomore year and actually trained with the Puerto Rican team.Ã‚Â\\xa0 It's definitely something special.Ã‚Â\\xa0 It's super special definitely because my grandmother and my grandfather, they love it down there.Ã‚Â\\xa0 If I get a chance down there to go play for them, best bet I'm going to bring them with me.  It's just a special moment, and knowing that there's a lot of Hispanics down in the Miami Heat, that's going to bring a lot more people, it's super special, man.  My mind right now is twirling.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I'm going to be honest with you.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I'm just super happy right now.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Shabazz, can you talk about coming from where you are, an area that's not really known for developing players, not as known as it should be perhaps, to get to this point.  SHABAZZ NAPIER:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Yeah, I didn't do it on my own, I can tell you that much.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I got about a handful of guys that pushed me to get to where I am now.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I'm just so happy that they were able to do that.  I mean, it was tough.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Just like any other neighborhood, there's always people that's going to compete with you.Ã‚Â\\xa0 It was tough.Ã‚Â\\xa0 But they allowed me to understand and see what I can be.  From when I was young, 8 years old, little kid running on the court during halftime shooting basketballs, to me right now in front of you guys who continue to push me.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Like I said, it's a special feeling.  Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Born in Roxbury?  SHABAZZ NAPIER:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Yeah, Roxbury.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 You had said you felt you were the best point guard in the draft, and after all you proved at UConn, but it ended up being a handful of guys went ahead of you anyway.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Does that put the chip back on your shoulder going into this?  SHABAZZ NAPIER:Ã‚Â\\xa0 No, the chip never leaves my shoulder.Ã‚Â\\xa0 It will never leave my shoulder.Ã‚Â\\xa0 That's what makes me who I am.Ã‚Â\\xa0 And I was saying that not to belittle any other point guards.Ã‚Â\\xa0 There's a reason why they're here.Ã‚Â\\xa0 But I was just saying that because that's who I am.  I wouldn't be Shabazz Napier if I wouldn't have said that.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I believe it, and I'm going to prove it.Ã‚Â\\xa0 What I always learned was that whatever you put in is what you're going to get out.Ã‚Â\\xa0 If I don't put in the work, it's not going to show.  So there's always a chip on my shoulder to prove to myself that I'm the best, and to do that, I've got to work hard.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 We know LeBron has said some very good things about you.Ã‚Â\\xa0 He likes your game.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Are you now ready to be a recruiter, per se, for Miami to help him stay?  SHABAZZ NAPIER:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I would hope so.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I would hope so.Ã‚Â\\xa0 He's one of the best players in the world.Ã‚Â\\xa0 So if me going there helps him come back, it just betters our chances of being a complete team.  But at the end of the day, my job is to get to improve and work on my game so when it comes to the stage where it's my first game, I'm ready to compete, and I'm prepared.  \"}, 'Doug McDermott': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=100456', 'text': \"Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Congratulations, Doug.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Chicago was a great defensive team, but they've struggled on offense, and you're somebody that can score the ball.Ã‚Â\\xa0 What are your thoughts about going to that team and being able to help them on the offensive end?  DOUG McDERMOTT:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I feel like I can really do that.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I feel like, with my ability to shoot it, I think I can help them from day one, and I definitely have to get a lot better defensively because Coach Thibodeau is a defensive‑minded guy.  I'm working on that already.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I know what it takes.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I'm a competitor.Ã‚Â\\xa0 So I'm looking forward to learning some of the different ways.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Doug, you mentioned going to a very defensive‑minded team.Ã‚Â\\xa0 That's not what you're known for.Ã‚Â\\xa0 How do you change?Ã‚Â\\xa0 How do you evolve at the next level to become a defensive‑minded player?  DOUG McDERMOTT:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I've just got to be a sponge and soak it all in from all the guys on the team and coaches.Ã‚Â\\xa0 They know what they're doing.Ã‚Â\\xa0 The numbers don't lie, how good a defensive team Coach has been.  I've just got to be able to absorb all the information, get some practice in, play some Summer League with them, and just get adjusted to the system, and I think I'll be just fine.  Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Has it sunk in yet, Derrick Rose, Joakim Noah, maybe Carmelo Anthony?  DOUG McDERMOTT:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Not at all.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I've just been trying to enjoy the moment.Ã‚Â\\xa0 D Rose is one of my favorite players.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I was a huge Gator fan.Ã‚Â\\xa0 So I love Joakim.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I can't even believe I'm about to join their team.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 About Coach Thibodeau and about the culture of the Chicago Bulls of playing hard, having a lot of heart, being able to get through adversity, talk about how that's going to really inspire you to be able to step your game up quickly in the pros.  DOUG McDERMOTT:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I think it's a great fit.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I'm a four‑year guy.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I've been through a lot of adversity.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I know what it takes to win.  I just really think this is a great fit.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I'm a competitor.Ã‚Â\\xa0 You can obviously tell by Coach Thibodeau that he's a serious competitor, too.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I think we're going to get along great.  Even though I played for my dad for four years, I'm ready for that next step to play for a different coach.  Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 You want to be a head coach down the line.Ã‚Â\\xa0 So Coach Thibodeau will be great inspiration, right?  DOUG McDERMOTT:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Definitely.Ã‚Â\\xa0 A guy named Kyle Korver, who played at Creighton and who's on the Hawks now, played for the Bulls for a couple seasons.Ã‚Â\\xa0 He told me‑‑ he just got off the phone with me.Ã‚Â\\xa0 He's telling me, I'm going to love it in Chicago.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 What has this night been like for you with the trade?Ã‚Â\\xa0 And how great does it feel to see they gave up two picks for you and wanted you that badly?  DOUG McDERMOTT:Ã‚Â\\xa0 It means a lot.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I just got off the phone with Coach Thibodeau and Gar Forman and John Paxson.Ã‚Â\\xa0 That means a lot to me, people excited to have me on their team.Ã‚Â\\xa0 It's a different process when you go to college, you've got to pick where you want to go, and now you're relying on those guys to pick you.  It meant a lot that they saw that in me, and I'm just really excited.  Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Quick question:Ã‚Â\\xa0 You're a Midwest guy.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I imagine that this is probably a good fit for that reason.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I was wondering if you could talk about the non‑basketball opportunities by being in a city like Chicago.Ã‚Â\\xa0 From basketball, what would you want to do if you weren't in this game that maybe Chicago could offer when your career is over?  DOUG McDERMOTT:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Chicago is a great city.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I got my marketing degree at Creighton.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I feel like that can apply well in a big city like Chicago, and I feel like it's going to help me out down the road.  Like I said earlier, I plan on being a coach someday in basketball‑‑ you know, whenever that ends.Ã‚Â\\xa0 So there's not a better guy to listen to on a day‑to‑day basis than Coach Thibodeau.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Did you see the Bulls played last year, and what were your impressions of them?  DOUG McDERMOTT:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Yeah, I was actually at a playoff game this year against the Wizards with my agent.Ã‚Â\\xa0 So it's pretty ironic that I'm ending up with them.Ã‚Â\\xa0 He represents Bradley Beal, so we were able to watch them play.  I just see a team that plays really good defense.Ã‚Â\\xa0 They're sometimes a couple baskets away from winning games, and I think I can provide that.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I think I can help on the offensive end.  Also, I think I can contribute right away just being the competitor I am, and I'm going to bring the hard work to the table from day one.  \"}, 'K.J.

So being called up there was a great feeling.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I\\'m happy that Philly picked me.  Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I\\'m kind of curious.Ã‚Â\\xa0 When you see players working out, we figure the team wants to evaluate talent.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I\\'m kind of curious do the executives take you to at least get familiar with the city?  K.J.

Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 They were chanting your name.  K.J. McDANIELS:Ã‚Â\\xa0 [Laughing.] Q.How does it feel to join a group of guys like Joel Embiid, Michael Carter‑Williams, guys like that?  K.J. McDANIELS:Ã‚Â\\xa0 It\\'s a great feeling because I\\'ve watched those guys play, and to be in there, I feel like we can all come together and make‑‑ get Philly back on the map and be one of the elite teams in the Eastern Conference.  So being able to go play with those younger guys, I feel like we can all learn off each other, and I feel like we would be a pretty good team.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Philly\\'s got a pretty young core, and it seems like they\\'re pretty open to competition when it comes to starting.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Do you feel like you could come in and start immediately as a swing man there?  K.J.

They know how hard I\\'ve worked, and to have them here, it\\'s a great moment for me and them as well.Ã‚Â\\xa0 So just them supporting me means a lot to me, and I love them for that.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 What\\'s like your not personal connection, but how close are you with your cousins?Ã‚Â\\xa0 Everyone is not close to their cousins.Ã‚Â\\xa0 And what are their names?  K.J.

Alabama raised me.Ã‚Â\\xa0 So I get my fight from there.Ã‚Â\\xa0 So shout out to Alabama.

Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Philly is a team that\\'s shown that they\\'re very willing to move people around, whether it\\'s train them or put them in the D‑League.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Is that something that\\'s in the back of your mind?Ã‚Â\\xa0 Is that a concern of yours?  K.J.

ZACH LaVINE:Ã‚Â\\xa0 There's so many.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Seattle is a big ground for basketball.Ã‚Â\\xa0 There's so many players that have been brought up.Ã‚Â\\xa0 So many players in the league.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I played with Tony Wroten in high school.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I work out with Jamal Crawford, Will Conroy, Terrence Williams, I.T., all them dudes helped me out.Ã‚Â\\xa0 It's incredible.  I'm really cool with Jamal Crawford, though.Ã‚Â\\xa0 He really helped me along.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I text him.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I'm definitely going to give him a text after this as well.  Seattle is the underground for basketball, I feel like.  Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Are you looking forward to playing with fellow Bruin alum Kevin love?  ZACH LaVINE:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Yeah, man.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I'm looking forward just to go there.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Kevin Love is one of the greats in the NBA right now.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I'm excited.  Also, Shabazz is on the team from UCLA as well.Ã‚Â\\xa0 So I'm ecstatic.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 When you got picked, you seemed to have some emotion on your face.Ã‚Â\\xa0 What went through your mind?Ã‚Â\\xa0 And what were you actually saying?Ã‚Â\\xa0 You seemed to mouth a few words out loud.Ã‚Â\\xa0 People were wondering what that was on TV.  ZACH LaVINE:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Just I can't believe this is happening.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I've been waiting for this my whole life.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I saw the cameras come over, but it was just like a rush of emotions still.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I had to put my head down.  I'm on cloud nine right now.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I'm really just trying to take it in.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I had a rush of emotion.Ã‚Â\\xa0 It still ain't sunk in yet.

RODNEY HOOD:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I watched them a lot.Ã‚Â\\xa0 They got Trey already.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Just drafted Dante.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I know Derrick Favors.Ã‚Â\\xa0 They got good young bigs and got some good guys on the wing.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I think I can add depth to their team.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Talk about being a kid from a small town in Mississippi and now being in the NBA.  RODNEY HOOD:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Man, it's unbelievable.Ã‚Â\\xa0 It's just‑‑ you think‑‑ excuse me.Ã‚Â\\xa0 You think of this little kid playing in the Boys and Girls Club, wanting to be like your big brother and getting a chance to walk across the stage and give some people hope from where I'm from, it means a lot.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 The fact that Salt Lake is probably the smallest media market in the NBA.Ã‚Â\\xa0 You're from a small town in Mississippi.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Any comfort in that?Ã‚Â\\xa0 Although the only bad thing is their plane trips are very long because there's no team near Salt Lake. Ã‚Â\\xa0That could take a toll on you as the season goes on.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I'm curious if you know much about Salt Lake City per se besides the basketball.  RODNEY HOOD:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I've never been to the city.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I didn't get a chance to go and work out for them.Ã‚Â\\xa0 But I'm interested to go there.Ã‚Â\\xa0 They've got a good up and coming team, right there on the verge of being a playoff team and making a run.  I'm just happy to be part of the organization.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I have to get used to it, but that's any city really.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Rodney, you're coming to the Utah Jazz.Ã‚Â\\xa0 They just got a new coach, Quin Snyder, who went to Duke.Ã‚Â\\xa0 What does that Duke connection mean to you?  RODNEY HOOD:Ã‚Â\\xa0 It means a lot.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Duke is a family.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Just because I decided to come to the NBA doesn't mean I'm shamed from the family.  Duke is a big brotherhood, and I just thank Quin Snyder and the general manager and people that made the decision on me, I really appreciate it.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Rodney, who are some of the players you admired from the Meridian, Mississippi area?  RODNEY HOOD:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Man, I grew up.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I watched some really good players.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Monta Ellis, I watched him since I was in high school.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Al Jefferson, who used to be with Utah a while ago, Jonathan Bender.  There's a lot of guys that come from Mississippi.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Antonio McDyess, we got a lot of good players around there.Ã‚Â\\xa0 So I was able to watch as a young player.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Rodney, what were your emotions sitting in the green room there as people kept going and going and it got down to just you and Shabazz there at the end?  RODNEY HOOD:Ã‚Â\\xa0 You know, obviously, everybody wants to go high and things like that, but me, I knew it was coming one way or another.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I'm just happy to land in a really good spot.  I'll be able to prove that I was supposed to have been picked higher in years to come.Ã‚Â\\xa0 There's a lot of good players that have been picked later in the first round.Ã‚Â\\xa0 So I want to add to their list.  Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 You just mentioned motivation.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Are there teams that you had indications that were going to draft you earlier?Ã‚Â\\xa0 And do you look forward to playing those teams this season?  RODNEY HOOD:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Most definitely.Ã‚Â\\xa0 All the teams that I talked to, I didn't get a negative report.Ã‚Â\\xa0 It just happens like that sometimes.  But I definitely‑‑ I can't wait to get back to‑‑ I'll go back to Mississippi for a couple of days, and I'll get right to work because I got a lot of proving to do in Summer League.  \"}, 'Gary Harris': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=100459', 'text': \"Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Yesterday you talked about how much you couldn't wait for this process to be over.Ã‚Â\\xa0 How nice is it to know now where you're going to be, where you're going to be living?Ã‚Â\\xa0 Is it exciting?  GARY HARRIS:Ã‚Â\\xa0 It's a lot better.Ã‚Â\\xa0 To know where I'm finally going is definitely a relief.  Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 What do you think about the fit with the Nuggets?  GARY HARRIS:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I'm looking forward to it.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I'm ready to get there and work and definitely earn a position there.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Nothing's going to be given to me.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I feel like it would be a great spot.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Did you work out for the Denver Nuggets?Ã‚Â\\xa0 Did you have a sense that Denver was interested in you?Ã‚Â\\xa0 How do you feel like you're going to contribute to that team?  GARY HARRIS:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Yes, I did work out for them.Ã‚Â\\xa0 To start off, I'm just going to go in there and play hard and do whatever they ask me to do.  Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Gary, talk about the motivation you have falling a little bit down in the first round, but also, too, being part of a Denver Nuggets team that needs a little bit of leadership as well as defense.Ã‚Â\\xa0 So talk about how you'll be able to contribute to that.  GARY HARRIS: Ã‚Â\\xa0Like I kind of alluded to my last question, I just want to go in there and put in work and just be able to go in there with the right attitude working every day and doing everything I can to help contribute to the team.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Tell me about the thought process that you get drafted, you get excited, you stand up, you go to one team, it's a pretty good team, it's excitement, and then a few steps, you go to a whole different city, whole different thought process, whole different history.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Describe that feeling because not too many people go through that.  GARY HARRIS:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I think it was easier for me to deal with it because I knew that the Nuggets had that Bulls 16th pick because I knew the trade before.Ã‚Â\\xa0 So once I knew that Chicago would supposedly draft me, I knew I was still going to Denver.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Brian Shaw is a brilliant‑‑ is a very good young coach, and he has a lot of experience in championship situations.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Are you looking forward to being able to get some good advice from him on how to be a professional and how to be a winner?  GARY HARRIS:Ã‚Â\\xa0 No, I'm going there and going to learn.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Definitely a new process for me.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Never been in the situation before.Ã‚Â\\xa0 So I'm looking forward to going there to learn a lot.  \"}, 'Aaron Gordon': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=100441', 'text': \"Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Aaron, congratulations.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Talk about the young talent Tobias Harris and Victor Oladipo and Nikola Vucevic.Ã‚Â\\xa0 How are you looking to grow with that group and maybe make the playoffs next year?  AARON GORDON:Ã‚Â\\xa0 It makes it easy for me because Victor Oladipo and Tobias Harris, they're both good pros already.Ã‚Â\\xa0 They're young, and we can grow together.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Very gritty, hard‑working people.Ã‚Â\\xa0 That's who I am.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I couldn't be happier to be playing with them, man.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I really couldn't be.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 When did you realize that it was Orlando, and were you surprised?  AARON GORDON:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Yeah, I was.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I learned probably‑‑ Andrew's my agent.Ã‚Â\\xa0 He told me probably five minutes before they called my name.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Five minutes before the clock started counting down.  I worked out pretty well when I was in Orlando.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I felt good about it.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I met with Coach Vaughn.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I met with Rob Hennigan, Scott Perry, a couple other guys.Ã‚Â\\xa0 And it just clicked, man, it really clicked.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Did you have a feeling you were going to be chosen with the Magic because that suit is the exact blue they wear?  AARON GORDON:Ã‚Â\\xa0 No.  Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 It's close.  AARON GORDON:Ã‚Â\\xa0 It is close, but I really came in today having no idea.Ã‚Â\\xa0 The anxiety and the anticipation was all there.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I just happened to like this color.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 You played in Tucson.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Orlando is kind of like Tucson, except a lot more humidity, no cold weather.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Did your agent tell you you lucked out because there's no state income tax in Florida?Ã‚Â\\xa0 You may have been the biggest winner here so far.  AARON GORDON:Ã‚Â\\xa0 My sister was the first one that brought that up to me.  Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Was she an accounting manager?  AARON GORDON:Ã‚Â\\xa0 No, she just graduated from Harvard.Ã‚Â\\xa0 So she's a smart girl.  Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I'm proud of her.  AARON GORDON:Ã‚Â\\xa0 That's my manager.Ã‚Â\\xa0 That's who's going to be living with me out there.  Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Business school or undergrad?  AARON GORDON:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Undergrad.  Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 What about the workout clicked with Orlando?Ã‚Â\\xa0 I know you said yesterday you thought you might go 4 to 8.Ã‚Â\\xa0 How strongly did you feel it could be Orlando?  AARON GORDON:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Pretty strongly, but when I got in a one‑on‑one circumstance with all the teams 4 to 8, I thought I did very well.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I showed them things that maybe they previously didn't think I could do.  When I got to Orlando, they just liked my game.Ã‚Â\\xa0 They liked my skill set.Ã‚Â\\xa0 They know how hard I worked, and I'm going to continue to do that.Ã‚Â\\xa0 What I've done to get myself here will never fade away.Ã‚Â\\xa0 That's who I am.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Everything else, I'm just going to start adding on and continue adding on.   Q. Ã‚Â\\xa0Aaron, first of all, welcome to Central Florida.Ã‚Â\\xa0 How much of the Orlando Magic have you seen, and what do you bring to that roster?  AARON GORDON:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I haven't seen a whole lot, not a whole lot.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I was very focused on college basketball this past year.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I wasn't even watching a lot of the NBA.  So I started watching recently.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I've been on Synergy and stuff like that, but I know they're a very young talented team.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I know with a few missing pieces or a few pieces, we could be very good.  Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 What do you bring to the team?  AARON GORDON:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I bring energy.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I bring defense.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I bring a mismatch problem, and I just bring a high character teammate.

DANTE EXUM:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Looking at the Draft and where I was placed, me and my agent thought that I wouldn't get down to 5, but anything happens in the Draft, and you see I'm lucky enough that Utah believed in me and pick me up at 5.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 And your thoughts about you and Trey Burke are both point guards.Ã‚Â\\xa0 What are your thoughts about that?  DANTE EXUM:Ã‚Â\\xa0 The Australian team, Patty Mills and Matthew Dellavedova, and I'm in that system, and those are both point guards.Ã‚Â\\xa0 So you work around it.  I think I already spoke to him, and he's excited to have me, and I'm excited to be there.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I know we're both going to give up something a little so everyone's happy.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Dante, congratulations and welcome to Utah.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Last year the Utah Jazz had one of the worst offenses in the league.Ã‚Â\\xa0 What can you give the Jazz fans to cheer about?  DANTE EXUM:Ã‚Â\\xa0 They got a new coach now, so I'm sure it's going to be a different system.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I like to play up and down and kind of find my guys in transition.  I think the coach being a point guard, he's going to know how to utilize me and Trey.Ã‚Â\\xa0 So that's what I mean to do.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Dante, congratulations.Ã‚Â\\xa0 How much have you seen the Utah Jazz play over the last year or so?Ã‚Â\\xa0 And, two, in your limited conversations with the franchise, what's impressed you most about the direction they're headed in?Ã‚Â\\xa0 Is? DANTE EXUM:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I haven't seen a lot of Utah.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Over in Australia, that's not one of the teams that play.Ã‚Â\\xa0 We only get three games a week.Ã‚Â\\xa0 So I'm excited to learn what their culture is about and the rich history they've had.  What was the last question?  Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 What's impressed you so far?Ã‚Â\\xa0 In the conversations you've had about the direction they're heading in it.  DANTE EXUM:Ã‚Â\\xa0 They brought in a new coach who's a point guard.Ã‚Â\\xa0 So that's exciting for me and just to be able to put myself in a situation where I'm able to learn and grow as a player and point guard.Ã‚Â\\xa0 So I think that's the most exciting thing.  Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Dante, so the Jazz went into this process pretty clear they wanted to get a franchise player and an All‑Star out of this pick.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Is that you?Ã‚Â\\xa0 If so, can you talk a little bit about why that's in your future.  DANTE EXUM:Ã‚Â\\xa0 That's the future.Ã‚Â\\xa0 You never know what's going to happen in the future.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I take it one day at a time.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I'm trying to do what I can now so I can get to that caliber.Ã‚Â\\xa0 There's been many players that have been projected and never got to that.  But I'm just going to work hard every day and see what happens.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 How excited are you to move past this process now and play five‑on‑five again and introduce yourself to the NBA.  DANTE EXUM:Ã‚Â\\xa0 It has been a long process.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I played a bit of five‑on‑five but not enough.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Just to know where I'm going to be living is just a huge relief.  I can't wait for Summer League, and I can't wait for the season to start.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Talk about coming to a new country and being able to adjust to the culture and everything and the language‑‑ well, not language, the culture and just how things are done in the professional level in America.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Talk about your learning curve.  DANTE EXUM:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I've been here for four or five months, and Australia's very similar to the U.S., so I don't think coming over here is going to be too much of a cultural difference.  It is going to be a learning experience heading into the professional world.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I've had a bit of practice with the AAS and learning how to be a professional, but you never know until you get there.  I'm just looking forward to clinging on to someone that knows the ropes already and learning off them and what they've done to be successful and stay in the NBA.  \"}, 'Tyler Ennis': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=100453', 'text': \"Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Tyler, you're going to a team that's got a lot of guards.Ã‚Â\\xa0 How do you fit into that system?Ã‚Â\\xa0 And are you prepared to maybe have to play the backseat for a little bit?  TYLER ENNIS:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I'm more than ready to work.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I think at this level you definitely have to earn your keep, earn your minutes on any team you go to.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I think this is no different situation.  I'm ready to come in and learn the system, learn from the veterans, and just earn my keep.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Tyler, do you think that Nash having a history in Phoenix, maybe they're looking to you to bring that run‑and‑gun style back to Phoenix?  TYLER ENNIS:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I never thought about that, but definitely, if they see something in me that they seen in Steve and the career he had, I'm definitely more than happy to go in there and do the same thing that Steve did.  Q. Ã‚Â\\xa0How do you think your impact of you being drafted will have an effect on Canada basketball as a whole?  TYLER ENNIS:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I think this is a big year.Ã‚Â\\xa0 We had the No. 1 pick.Ã‚Â\\xa0 We had Nik go in the lottery, myself, and a bunch of other Canadians who are still waiting to hear their name called.  At the end of the night, Canada has something to be proud of.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Tyler, Phoenix had a great turnaround last year, almost making the playoffs, winning 47, 48 games.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Talk about how excited are you to be able to be part of a franchise on the upswing and with a coach like Jeff Hornacek who has the trust of his players already.  TYLER ENNIS:Ã‚Â\\xa0 That's definitely something that's attractive with the young talent Phoenix has, a young core group of guys, and they had a really good season last year.  I think heading into next year, it will be a hungry team, and I'm more than happy to go in there and contribute to that.  Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 You talked about how the Suns style fits yours.Ã‚Â\\xa0 It's obviously a very up‑tempo style.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Could you talk a little more about why you like that style of play.  TYLER ENNIS:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I think when you have talent on the wings as a point guard, to get up and down, we have some of the best athletes in the game.Ã‚Â\\xa0 But with myself, I see myself not turning the ball over too much, and I think when you're on the fast break running, you get vulnerable if you turn over the ball.  I think I fit the system going up and down and finding guys in transition.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Michael Carter‑Williams, another Syracuse point guard, was here.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Did you get a chance to catch up with him yet?  TYLER ENNIS:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Yeah, I seen Michael last night at a dinner.Ã‚Â\\xa0 He just gave me a couple words of advice, just to relax and enjoy it and just to continue working hard.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I seen him today, and he congratulated me.  It's good to have somebody in your corner that went through the same thing as you and is just there to help you.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 How strange will it be to spend winter in a place where there won't be any snow?  TYLER ENNIS:Ã‚Â\\xa0 This is probably going to be my first year not seeing snow, but I think change is good.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 All the guys here from the Canadian side all came from CIA Bounce.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Can you talk about the program and the impact of all the CIA Bounce making an impact at the next level.  TYLER ENNIS:Ã‚Â\\xa0 They definitely helped me get to where I am now.Ã‚Â\\xa0 The competition they put me from front of, the tournaments they put me in front of, everything they did for me, my whole AAU career growing up really helped prepare me for Syracuse first of all, but also the NBA.Ã‚Â\\xa0 CIA Bounce is one of the main factors that helped me get to this level.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Who's next from CIA Bounce?  TYLER ENNIS:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Jamal Murray.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 This is going to the future, speaking of Canada, talk about the 2016 team, the Olympic team.Ã‚Â\\xa0 You guys could give the U.S. a run for that gold medal?  TYLER ENNIS:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I think we could put together a really good team.Ã‚Â\\xa0 2016 might be early.Ã‚Â\\xa0 The U.S. is going to have a tough team regardless of what year it is.  I think, once we get in the gym together, getting chemistry and just get all the talent in one gym for the first time, I think that will be a big moment for Canada.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I think not only 2016, but the following Olympics I think we'll be able to make a run at it.  \"}, 'Clint Capela': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=100462', 'text': \"Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Are you going to play this season, and how do you feel to be in Houston?

Right now I'm going to work on getting my degree.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I'm going to go back to school.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I'm going to take things slow.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I'm only 20 years old, and I'm ready to do whatever I can to make my life better.  Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 From the news of the disorder to today, what's the emotional roller coaster been like?  ISAIAH AUSTIN:Ã‚Â\\xa0 It's been crazy.Ã‚Â\\xa0 My emotions have been from sad to the happiest I can be just a few minutes ago.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I'm still happy, and I'm thankful for it.  These past couple days have really taught me a lot about myself.Ã‚Â\\xa0 They've really shown me that no matter what obstacle you're thrown in life, there's always a way around it, or there's always a way through it.Ã‚Â\\xa0 There's no reason somebody should hang their head or not have confidence in themselves in doing something.  So for the rest of my life, I'm going to keep a positive attitude, and I'm not going to take anything for granted because it can be ripped away from you in seconds.  I was having a great day before I found out the news, and everything that I've grown up to know and love was just taken from me.Ã‚Â\\xa0 But it's really just one of the biggest blessings of my life because it did save it.  Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 What's this day been like?Ã‚Â\\xa0 What's this day been like for you being around all these potential players, us, the media?Ã‚Â\\xa0 What's this been like for you?Ã‚Â\\xa0 Do you think one day we'll see you as an NBA coach?  ISAIAH AUSTIN:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Today has been a dream come true.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I've met so many people that are supporting me, and they don't even know me on a personal level.Ã‚Â\\xa0 So it just shows the heart and character that all these people have.  Just being around all the draftees and seeing all my friends get drafted, it just brings joy in my heart because I know how hard we work to get to this point.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I've been through it.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Everything, the late nights in the gym, the early mornings in the gym, the injuries, the tears, the sweat, the blood, everything.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I've been through all of that.Ã‚Â\\xa0 To see them walk across that stage is one of the biggest blessings of my life because everybody around you is in a different situation, but everybody is pushing through.  Just to see how people persevere through their own problems, because everybody has their own problems, it's touching, and it's heart warming really.  Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 One day you want to be an NBA coach?Ã‚Â\\xa0 Is that something that you probably‑‑ you said you couldn't play.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Would you like coaching at this high level?Ã‚Â\\xa0 Would that be something you'd like to do?  ISAIAH AUSTIN:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Yeah, definitely, I would love to coach.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I love learning about the game, and I'm still going to be a student of the game, even though I can't play.Ã‚Â\\xa0 So I'm just going to work as hard as I can to get to that point in my career.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Isaiah, when you found out about your condition, was it on Sunday?  ISAIAH AUSTIN:Ã‚Â\\xa0 It was actually‑‑ was Sunday the 21st?Ã‚Â\\xa0 It was the night of the 21st.  Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Can you just take us through actually what you did that day, what activities you did, and who actually made the call to you.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Did you pick up the phone?Ã‚Â\\xa0 Did someone else hand you the phone?  ISAIAH AUSTIN:Ã‚Â\\xa0 My parents originally found out the information the night before.Ã‚Â\\xa0 As soon as they heard, they packed up their bags, and my family drove nine hours from Kansas City to Dallas where I was at.  I remember that morning I woke up early in the gym, and I was working out.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I got shots up, and then later that afternoon, I was at Mo Williams' house.Ã‚Â\\xa0 He had a barbecue.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I work out at his gym, so I've gotten to know him pretty well.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I was just hanging around him and his family, and they're great people.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I'm thankful for them because they gave me an opportunity to interact with their family and their personal life.  I remember I was driving home with my high school coach, Coach Ray, and we're doing the same thing that we do all the time, laughing and joking around.Ã‚Â\\xa0 As soon as we pulled up to the house, I just noticed a variety of cars, and I noticed a couple of them that I recognized.  I remember asking him what was up, and he couldn't even look at me.  Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Your father?  ISAIAH AUSTIN:Ã‚Â\\xa0 No, my high school coach.  Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 So he knew on the ride home?  ISAIAH AUSTIN:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Yeah, he did.Ã‚Â\\xa0 He found out on the ride home.Ã‚Â\\xa0 He couldn't even look at me.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I remember walking through the door.Ã‚Â\\xa0 There was 10, 15 people there, my Baylor coaching staff, my pastor, a couple of my close friends, and my family.  The first person's face who I saw was my mother's.Ã‚Â\\xa0 She was all the way in the back.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I just remember seeing tears falling down her eyes.Ã‚Â\\xa0 My dad's arms around her.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I knew right then exactly what it was because I remembered in Chicago they said I could have had this syndrome, and they did blood work on it.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I just hadn't gotten the results back.  I wanted to break down and cry, but I didn't because my little brother and sister were in the room.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I wanted to show them that I could be strong for them and for my family because they look up to me.  Later that night, I just remember I couldn't sleep.Ã‚Â\\xa0 It was devastating.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Can you talk about when Adam Silver called you or who called you from the NBA to invite you here tonight, and what was that like?Ã‚Â\\xa0 After getting the devastating news that you wouldn't be able to play but still being invited to be at the Draft and be a part of everything.  ISAIAH AUSTIN:Ã‚Â\\xa0 It was heart warming.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I remember Commissioner Silver, he didn't personally call me, but he called my agent Dwon Clifton, and he let me know that he wanted me to be his personal guest for the night.Ã‚Â\\xa0 It was just joy.  I forgot about the syndrome for a while.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I just couldn't stop thinking of, I'm going to New York, I'm going to New York for the NBA Draft.Ã‚Â\\xa0 It's always been my dream to go to New York.  I got here, and I remember it was so surreal, just a surreal moment.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I'm here today, and I'm blessed, and I'm thankful.  Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 What was it like hearing your name called in that environment?  ISAIAH AUSTIN:Ã‚Â\\xa0 That was like a dream come true really.Ã‚Â\\xa0 When you're playing basketball and you're growing up and you're at a competitive high level, and you're being recruited highly and everybody's saying that you have such potential, that's your dream to be able to walk across that stage and hearing your name called.  When he did it, my head just dropped because, you know, it was almost too much for me to handle.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Fortunately, he did, and I'm thankful for it.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Forgive me, I remember reading something about it.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Can you describe what this malady is.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Aside from sports, you could have a full, normal life.Ã‚Â\\xa0 And if you want to talk about what your studying at Baylor.  ISAIAH AUSTIN:Ã‚Â\\xa0 The syndrome is called Marfan syndrome.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Basically, the connective tissues in your body are weakened because the cells aren't fully developed.  I have the symptoms of an enlarged aortic artery and long arms, long legs, stretch marks across my body.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Really the symptom is‑‑ it's not deadly when you're living your everyday life, but it can be because my aortic artery has been growing for the past two years.Ã‚Â\\xa0 That's what they've been saying.Ã‚Â\\xa0 If it gets too enlarged, I will have to go under open‑heart surgery.  But playing basketball was a risk to me because, if my body exerts too much energy, I can pump too much blood.  Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Is this Marfan associated with tall people or across all heights and genders?  ISAIAH AUSTIN:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Mainly the symptoms say tall people, but there have been a few cases where it's normal sized people.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Really I'm just starting to get to know about it, too.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I just found out about it like last week.Ã‚Â\\xa0 We're doing as much as we can to research it, and I'm now going to be one of the spokesman for the Marfan foundation.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I'm going to learn more about it in days to come.  Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 What are you studying at Baylor right now?  ISAIAH AUSTIN:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Right now I'm studying business.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Talk about Baylor has had a great tradition of basketball over the past few years.Ã‚Â\\xa0 With your condition and with the adversity you've gone through, talk about how you can be an inspiration for future basketball players that want to come to Baylor and how you can be a mentor to young athletes.  ISAIAH AUSTIN:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I don't want to be just an inspiration to people who play basketball.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I want to be an inspiration to people all over the world.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Just because I face obstacles, but people have different obstacles in their life that they're facing.  I want them to know that they can push through anything because I've done it.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Everyone in this room has pushed through an obstacle in their life one way or the other.Ã‚Â\\xa0 So I just want them to know they have the power within themselves to do it if they keep faith and a positive attitude.  Going to Baylor was a huge blessing, and I'm thankful for it.Ã‚Â\\xa0 It's a great basketball school, and it's a great program.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Coach Drew was fortunate‑‑ I mean, Coach Drew has blessed me enough to let me be a part of that program, and I'm thankful.  \"}, 'Thanasis Antetokounmpo, Giannis Antetokounmpo': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=100464', 'text': \"Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 The New York Knicks are going through a transition period right now.Ã‚Â\\xa0 It's an audition process for even the incumbents in that organization.Ã‚Â\\xa0 So talk about how you're ready to use your athleticism and your diverse game to be able to hopefully be in the rotation next season.  THANASIS ANTETOKOUNMPO:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I'm going to do whatever‑‑ I'm going to do everything, whatever the coach tells me to.Ã‚Â\\xa0 You'll probably laugh, but I'll do whatever the coach tells me to, from play 40 minutes to waving the towel to taking the last shot.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I'll do whatever Coach wants me to in order to win.  I would like to say something:Ã‚Â\\xa0 For those who don't know, last year we were in the same place, like the same day.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I was just sitting on the left, and he (Giannis Antetokounmpo) was sitting on the right.Ã‚Â\\xa0 He got drafted by the Bucks last year, my brother.Ã‚Â\\xa0 And being here and all the blessings I've received today from God and from my family, I really want to say thank you to the Knicks for drafting me and putting faith in me to do the best.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 This question is for both of you:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Being here in the same place, you were here last year with your brother when he got drafted.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Compare and contrast the feeling from last year, and, Giannis, if you can do the same thing from getting drafted last year and now being here with your brother.  THANASIS ANTETOKOUNMPO:Ã‚Â\\xa0 It's an amazing feeling.Ã‚Â\\xa0 It's almost the same feeling because everything starts this is the day.Ã‚Â\\xa0 We enjoy this day, and we have blessing, and we know that tomorrow's another day.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Everything start from the beginning.Ã‚Â\\xa0 To make things happen.  GIANNIS ANTETOKOUNMPO:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I'm really happy for Thanasis.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I'm really proud of him.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I'm more happier this day more than last year in the draft for myself.  So I'm really excited for Thanasis to go to the New York Knicks.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Hopefully, he does well, and he prove himself.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I'm sure he's going to try his best.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I don't know if you're aware of this, but Astoria, New York, has the largest Greek‑American community in the United States.  THANASIS ANTETOKOUNMPO:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Today on my way to New York, I had like so many messages from people that are Greeks, they told me, if you're coming to New York.Ã‚Â\\xa0 We're going to try to come see you.Ã‚Â\\xa0 If you can, try to stay just to see people and take me to different places.  I'm just thinking about the Summer League and the first time I step on the court to practice.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Giannis, what would it mean for both of you guys to be in the NBA, if Thanasis can make the Knicks roster?Ã‚Â\\xa0 And just this achievement even tonight, what does it mean to you?  GIANNIS ANTETOKOUNMPO:Ã‚Â\\xa0 First of all, I'll just say hi, Charlie.Ã‚Â\\xa0 For us as kids, it was our dream to be in the NBA.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I make it last year.Ã‚Â\\xa0 He make it this year.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Hopefully, our other brother will follow our footsteps and make it too.  For us and for our family, today, everybody, all of our family was here, and we're really happy and excited to see Thanasis in the NBA too.  THANASIS ANTETOKOUNMPO:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I would like to say thank you to everybody in the NBA Development League, the D‑League.Ã‚Â\\xa0 It helps.Ã‚Â\\xa0 People don't know it, but it helps a lot of players play, and I think we're going to see more from the D‑League.  I would like to thank‑‑ I love my parents to death and everybody in my family for supporting me till now and all my coaches and everybody in Delaware and back in Greece and everybody.  Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 What do you know about Phil Jackson, and how excited are you to meet him and work with him?  THANASIS ANTETOKOUNMPO:Ã‚Â\\xa0 The first thing I know is he's the Zen Master.Ã‚Â\\xa0 First thing I know, he's been everything, done everything now, and he's seen everything.Ã‚Â\\xa0 He's the coach who coached Michael Jordan, Kobe Bryant.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Like the best of the best.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 What you've seen with the draft tonight and with the trade he made yesterday, is this kind of an exciting, refreshing organization you think you might be coming into?  THANASIS ANTETOKOUNMPO:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Of course it's something new, and my heart is aching from happiness, I can't even talk.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Giannis, how excited are you at the prospect of playing with Jabari Parker?  GIANNIS ANTETOKOUNMPO:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I'm really excited.Ã‚Â\\xa0 He's a great player.Ã‚Â\\xa0 He's a really good kid.Ã‚Â\\xa0 We talked a little bit after his workout with the Bucks, and I'm really excited.Ã‚Â\\xa0 He could take our team to the next level, and I'm really excited to play with him.  Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Thanasis, do you think the Greek community is going to adopt you, and by extension, the Knicks?  THANASIS ANTETOKOUNMPO:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Can you repeat that?  Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Meaning like root for the Knicks more than ever with you on the team.  THANASIS ANTETOKOUNMPO:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I don't really know, but I hope they do because we need it.Ã‚Â\\xa0 We, as Greeks, we have to support every Greek in every part of the world.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 What are your thoughts on Derek Fisher as the head coach of the New York Knicks?Ã‚Â\\xa0 And how aware are you of the Knicks fan base?Ã‚Â\\xa0 It's a very passionate fan base.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I can probably assure you that you're trending on Twitter right now.  THANASIS ANTETOKOUNMPO:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I mean, I'm just‑‑ I don't really have anything to say on that.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I'm just going to play, try to do my best for the coach.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Giannis, can you talk a little bit about your journey, the adjustments that you had to make coming from Greece, playing in the NBA, and what you've learned and what kind of advice you have now for your brother who will now make the same journey?  GIANNIS ANTETOKOUNMPO:Ã‚Â\\xa0 It was really hard for me because I came from Greece when I was 18.Ã‚Â\\xa0 So going to another country as 18‑year‑old kid is really hard to learn the culture.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Living alone was really hard.  With all that, I got to adjust to my game.Ã‚Â\\xa0 So adjusting in the NBA at the beginning was hard, but thank God I got some good veterans.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Caron Butler, Zaza Pachulia, O.J. Mayo, and a lot of other players that helped me a lot.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Thank God I was on that team.  That's what I tell my brother, just to go and train hard every day and try to learn something every day.Ã‚Â\\xa0 And in the day when the practice ends, when you leave the practice, just ask yourself, what did I learn today?Ã‚Â\\xa0 And that's going to take it to the next level.  Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 You probably know his game better than most of us anyway.Ã‚Â\\xa0 What are the gifts that you think that he has that will make him an effective NBA player?  GIANNIS ANTETOKOUNMPO:Ã‚Â\\xa0 The first thing that Thanasis do every day and every night that he step on the floor, like I'm amazed that he always play hard.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I'm amazed.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I never see that in any player.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Any time he step on the floor, he always give hard.Ã‚Â\\xa0 He give 100 percent.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Even he's tired, even he's hurt, he's going to play.  He's a really good player.Ã‚Â\\xa0 He's working on his shot, his midrange shot, I know that.Ã‚Â\\xa0 He's a really good kid.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Going to listen to the coach, respect his teammates, and be a good teammate.Ã‚Â\\xa0 He's going to put the team first before himself.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Thanasis, I know Giannis just talked about what your strengths are, but what do you think you can bring to the Knicks in your skill sets for those people who may not know that much about your game?  THANASIS ANTETOKOUNMPO:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I mean, everybody‑‑ like most of the coaches say it's‑‑ I mean, I'm an athletic player.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I'm a versatile player.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I'm a good defender and stuff.  But I think the best thing that I can bring to the Knicks is good character, reliable person, trustworthy.Ã‚Â\\xa0 You can depend on me to finish tasks.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Bring heart, passion to the game, courage to the game, and just bring wins.Ã‚Â\\xa0 That's it.Ã‚Â\\xa0 That's the only thing I think about.  Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 So Greece makes it to the knockout round and then you get drafted by the Knicks.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Pretty good week, huh?  THANASIS ANTETOKOUNMPO:Ã‚Â\\xa0 You can't imagine.Ã‚Â\\xa0 You can't imagine.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I was screaming when I saw that.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 At what age did you start playing basketball?  THANASIS ANTETOKOUNMPO:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I was 15, 15 1/2.  GIANNIS ANTETOKOUNMPO:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I was 15.  Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I have to ask you because I got a chance to look at it up close, and a lot of people are commenting on the internet.Ã‚Â\\xa0 What is your bowtie?Ã‚Â\\xa0 What is it made of?  THANASIS ANTETOKOUNMPO:Ã‚Â\\xa0 It's wood.  Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 It's wooden?  THANASIS ANTETOKOUNMPO:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Yeah, it's wood.  Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 What does that bring to the table?  GIANNIS ANTETOKOUNMPO:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Style.  THANASIS ANTETOKOUNMPO:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Nothing.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I just want to do something different.Ã‚Â\\xa0 My mom was there.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Mostly for my mom because she hasn't seen me in a long time.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I just want to have a little bit of a good smile.Ã‚Â\\xa0 It's a special day for my mom to see me and my dad and my family.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Thanasis, so who do you think would win in a game of one‑on‑one, you or your brother?  THANASIS ANTETOKOUNMPO:Ã‚Â\\xa0 They have asked me this question a million times.  GIANNIS ANTETOKOUNMPO:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Next.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I'm joking.Ã‚Â\\xa0 No, I can comment on that.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Whoever play harder and whoever play defense because we are‑‑ I think Thanasis can score any time on me, I can score any time on him.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Whoever play hardest plays defense.  THANASIS ANTETOKOUNMPO:Ã‚Â\\xa0 That one‑on‑one notion is never going to end, like never.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Before playing basketball, did you play any other sports?  THANASIS ANTETOKOUNMPO:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I remember, when we were like fifth grade or sixth grade, me and my brothers, we were in everything, soccer, volleyball, track, and like we used to really do sports, except basketball.  \"}}, 2015: {'Justise Winslow': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=110597', 'text': \"Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 How do you think that you, Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh will mesh in the first month of the regular season?  JUSTISE WINSLOW:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I feel like we can mesh well.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I feel like we're all so talented and can do so many things on the court that we'll be able to complement each other's skills and our presence on the court will be great.  I'm just ready to get down there, meet the guys, gel with the guys, and I know we'll have a bright future.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Obviously LeBron left before this past year, they kind of had a void at that position, and while it's not fair to compare you to the greatest player in the game right now, how do you feel that you can step into those big shoes?Ã‚Â\\xa0 And do you feel any pressure to play his role in that big three now? JUSTISE WINSLOW:Ã‚Â\\xa0 You know, for me it's not about filling anybody's shoes, coming in and replacing anybody.Ã‚Â\\xa0 That's what this is about.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Right now this is about me coming in, being myself, playing my game and not trying to be LeBron James.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Let LeBron James be LeBron James.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I'm going to be Justise Winslow.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Dwyane Wade will be Dwyane Wade and let the rest take care of itself.  I'm not the big three.Ã‚Â\\xa0 We're not the big three.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I'm Justise Winslow and I'm the newest member of the Miami Heat.  Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 What are you looking forward to about living in South Beach? JUSTISE WINSLOW:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I've never been to South Beach.Ã‚Â\\xa0 So it's always a play I wanted to go.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Growing up and the past couple of years I told myself, the first time I go to South Beach it's going to be a lot of fun.Ã‚Â\\xa0 And right now I'm just so excited to get down there and become a part of the organization.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 With what you know about Miami and what you know about yourself, what do you feel like you can bring to that team immediately? JUSTISE WINSLOW:Ã‚Â\\xa0 You know, just first off, defensively, I feel like I can come in and make an impact, being able to guard multiple positions and give a lot of energy on that end.Ã‚Â\\xa0 And offensively, did the same I did in college.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Let the game come to me while also still being aggressive and looking to score.  But I just feel like with the guys they have there, I'll be able to complement their skills really well and we can be a good team moving forward into the future.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Your name was linked as high as five, four, then you slide down to 10.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Blessing in disguise, but how did you keep it all in perspective?Ã‚Â\\xa0 And when did you know it was Miami? JUSTISE WINSLOW:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I knew about a minute, minute and a half before; my agent told me.Ã‚Â\\xa0 But for me I saw some of the mock drafts.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Of course my agent talking to the range, and so I saw myself kind of going down, getting down further in the teens, but for me it's a blessing.  It's not about the number I go, it's just about being part of the league and being a part of such a great organization.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I'm very happy.Ã‚Â\\xa0 You can say a blessing in disguise, but I just see it as a blessing, nothing disguised about it.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Being able to play professionally is something I always dreamed of, so obviously I'm just very happy.  Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 A lot has been made about your all‑around game.Ã‚Â\\xa0 What aspect do you think you need to improve on the most? JUSTISE WINSLOW:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I think just getting better with the ball in my hands, being able to create off the dribble, pick‑and‑roll situations, isolation situations.Ã‚Â\\xa0 But just getting my ball handling better because that's going to kind of go right in with my jump shot and ability to pass the ball.Ã‚Â\\xa0 You see a lot of the great ball handlers being able to create shots for themselves and for others.Ã‚Â\\xa0 So I think that's one of the big keys for my future.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 As we all know, Pat Riley is very ambitious as the president of Miami.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Are you excited to be in the win‑now territory, considering you could have been a top‑five‑pick/rebuilding process? JUSTISE WINSLOW:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Yeah, that's something that's definitely attractive and I like.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I've always won, always been a winner.Ã‚Â\\xa0 So to have a leader of an organization like Pat Riley, he's not trying to rebuild or look down the line, he's focused on right now.Ã‚Â\\xa0 That's something that really intrigues me and motivates me.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I don't want to look a couple years down the line; I want to win now.Ã‚Â\\xa0 And so to be a part of an organization with a leader like that is something that I really like.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 You have no control over who drafts you, but I'm wondering if things like no state income tax comes into play, warm weather climates, if that's a factor?  JUSTISE WINSLOW:Ã‚Â\\xa0 No, not really.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Hypothetically you think, oh, if I go to Detroit the weather is cold there, or if I go to LA the weather is‑‑ but it's just a blessing.Ã‚Â\\xa0 You're just trying to get picked.Ã‚Â\\xa0 You're not really thinking about pros and cons of the weather or the income tax, state income tax.  Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Your agent does, though.  JUSTISE WINSLOW:Ã‚Â\\xa0 You're just trying to get picked for a team.Ã‚Â\\xa0 So it's just a blessing.   Q. Ã‚Â\\xa0We talked a little bit about the championship pedigree there is within the team in the past years.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Can you talk about some of the young guys who have come in, Shabazz Napier, Hassan Whiteside.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I'm wondering what they can give you as you're learning the ropes?Ã‚Â\\xa0 Hopefully not too much rookie hazing coming in, but what can they tell you? JUSTISE WINSLOW:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I'm sure they can tell me a lot, just them going through the whole process.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Me being the new guy, I'm looking to learn, come in and learn from those guys and pick up everything I can.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I'm sure old guys, young guys, I'm sure they'll be very helpful, and so I'm looking forward to just going there and getting better, getting better from all those guys, the coaches and just becoming the best player I can be as a member of the Miami Heat.  \"}, 'Myles Turner': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=110598', 'text': 'Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Indiana has made no secret that they want to play faster.Ã‚Â\\xa0 You worked out for them.Ã‚Â\\xa0 How do you feel you fit in with them, Paul George, George Hill and those guys? MYLES TURNER:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I think it\\'s a perfect style of play for me.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I feel like I\\'m starting to get up and down the floor a lot better than I was at the collegiate level.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I like playing fast.Ã‚Â\\xa0 It\\'s just definitely what the NBA game is starting to turn into.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 As you head into the NBA, what aspect of your game would you say needs the most work? MYLES TURNER:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Probably just the details on everything, whether it\\'s defensive positioning, footwork, in the post, certain things like that that I\\'m sure Mr.Bird or Coach Bird can show me.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Seems like David West is on his way out of town, Roy Hibbert potentially could be, too.Ã‚Â\\xa0 How do you feel about potentially having to replace two big pieces of that front court, obviously Paul and George in the backcourt, but how do you feel about replacing those two guys or potentially playing with Roy this year? MYLES TURNER:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I\\'m comfortable with it.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I feel like those are two big names in the NBA.Ã‚Â\\xa0 This season might not have gone the way it was supposed to for them, but they\\'re still two very capable players, and I feel very fine and very fortunate to be playing with such great bigs.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 You said you weren\\'t supposed to be here.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Kind of expand on why you say that.  MYLES TURNER:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Right, right.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Basketball was just something I did for fun when I was younger.Ã‚Â\\xa0 It\\'s not really anything I really took that serious, and I think that there was a lot of obstacles in my way that were telling me that I shouldn\\'t be doing this, as far as whether it was people telling me that I\\'m not going to be any good at this, tall, lanky and goofy, you\\'re not supposed to be doing this, why are you playing?Ã‚Â\\xa0 Whether it was having a big injuries a couple summers ago.Ã‚Â\\xa0 There was a lot of things that came my way, but I overcame it just through my faith and hard work and dedication.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Walk me through your outfit.  MYLES TURNER:Ã‚Â\\xa0 So I figured no one would do the color purple, and blue is actually my favorite color, but I feel like purple goes well with my skin tone, so I had to bring it out there.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I didn\\'t want to go all purple, so that\\'s why I went with the white top, as well.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Going to the Indiana Pacers, playing with a guy like Paul George, has that processed yet?Ã‚Â\\xa0 Have you thought about what you\\'re going to bring to the dynamic? MYLES TURNER:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Yeah, I feel like I bring versatility.Ã‚Â\\xa0 That\\'s one thing I pride myself in being able to do, defend multiple positions, play multiple positions, and I feel like that\\'s one thing Paul George is very capable of doing, just because of his height and skill level, his ability to shoot the ball and handle the ball at 6\\'9\", 6\\'10\".Ã‚Â\\xa0 I think we are similar players.Ã‚Â\\xa0 He\\'s a lot more seasoned than me, so I feel like I can learn under him, as well.  Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 You said that you played basketball at the beginning just for fun and people were discouraging to you about it.Ã‚Â\\xa0 What kept you going?Ã‚Â\\xa0 Why did you stick with it? MYLES TURNER:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I\\'m a competitor, man.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I love proving people wrong.Ã‚Â\\xa0 That\\'s one thing that\\'s always kept me going.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I actually played baseball for a long time.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I thought I was going to go pro in baseball, but your boy started growing too much and that strike zone got way too big.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Man, people can really throw that ball.Ã‚Â\\xa0 It\\'s coming at 80, 90 miles per hour, it\\'s like time to hang it up.  Then I started hitting my growth spurt, started getting better and better and started improving.Ã‚Â\\xa0 As a competitor I just wanted to go out there and prove all these people wrong.  Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Was wearing glasses an issue growing up?  MYLES TURNER:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Not necessarily.Ã‚Â\\xa0 My dad made sure I was fitted right with the sports goggles, the Rec Specs, all that.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I definitely got made fun of a lot, but at the same time nobody discouraged me because I was out there doing what I do.  Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Any optical endorsement deals on the table now? MYLES TURNER:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I guess we\\'re about to find out.  '}, 'Karl-Anthony Towns': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=110590', 'text': \"Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Tell me about your draft outfit.  KARL‑ANTHONY TOWNS:Ã‚Â\\xa0 You know, for me, I just‑‑ this outfit really was special to me.Ã‚Â\\xa0 It just was me and my stylist came up with a great idea and I really wanted to go with it, including my sister's ideas.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Adrian really helped me, a designer for this, really helped me a lot.Ã‚Â\\xa0 My stylist was telling me the story about how it's eight meters of fabric that has only been in the world, and this suit is two and a half of it.Ã‚Â\\xa0 So he's really blessed me with a one of a kind suit for this special day in my life, and I really can't thank him enough.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 How many of your folks ended up being here, friends and family?Ã‚Â\\xa0 Do you know the final count, and what did mom and dad say there at the table when it was official?  KARL‑ANTHONY TOWNS:Ã‚Â\\xa0 They just really for me‑‑ I think my number is close to 50.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I mean, I'm home.Ã‚Â\\xa0 This is home to me.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I've been able to come here, have my‑‑ mostly all my closest friends, loved ones, family, come out here and realize one of the most special moments of my life.Ã‚Â\\xa0 My mom and dad, they were just so excited.Ã‚Â\\xa0 My sister started crying immediately.Ã‚Â\\xa0 My mom started crying.Ã‚Â\\xa0 My dad was just very ecstatic.Ã‚Â\\xa0 All those times me and him were in the gym, and you see the end result.  Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 You've always had a deep appreciation and respect for the history of the NBA.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Tell me about your feelings about following in the footsteps of Magic Johnson and LeBron James as the first overall pick and joining the Minnesota Timberwolves who have the greatest player in the franchise on their team right now, Kevin Garnett.  KARL‑ANTHONY TOWNS:Ã‚Â\\xa0 It just means the world to me.Ã‚Â\\xa0 It means the world to me to play with an organization that is‑‑ especially for me, my Dominican roots storied, with Felipe Lopez playing for them.Ã‚Â\\xa0 It just really is a great moment for me to keep the roots going in Minnesota and be able to just continue my legacy and just try and win more championships.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 You're stepping onto an even bigger platform and stage now off the court.Ã‚Â\\xa0 What do you hope to achieve?Ã‚Â\\xa0 What kind of example do you hope to set for all the kids looking up to you across the country? KARL‑ANTHONY TOWNS:Ã‚Â\\xa0 For me, I'm just blessed to be in this opportunity to just show that a boy from Piscataway, New Jersey, and Dominican Republic can make it.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I'm blessed to be in this situation, to be in this seat talking to all of you.Ã‚Â\\xa0 It just means the world that I'm going to be able to show kids around the world that with a little hard work, determination, a little bit of luck and some guidance, you can really make it far in this world.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 You said that you weren't given a promise but you worked out for one team.Ã‚Â\\xa0 When did you find out that Minnesota was taking you?  KARL‑ANTHONY TOWNS:Ã‚Â\\xa0 When I saw a man come out and walk out to a podium and say my name.Ã‚Â\\xa0 (Laughter).  When Mr.Adam Silver came out, I saw him, and he said, with the No.1 pick, I was racing.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I told Coach Cal before when he first came out that I was trying to drink the water and I was shaking uncontrollably, and I told him, Coach, don't give me the ball right now for the last‑second shot.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I wouldn't make it.  And I just found out when he went up there and he said it.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I was just shocked and just extremely happy that I was able to give my parents something that they can remember for the rest of their lives.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 You said you didn't know until just to night, but what kind of feeling did you come away with when Flip came out and watched you in LA a couple weeks ago and then your visit over the weekend? KARL‑ANTHONY TOWNS:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I mean, I thought they liked me, but I didn't know anything that it was going to be a done deal.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Everything that I just did, they gave me no consensus, they just mostly had me fly out to go see the facility.  You have no idea.Ã‚Â\\xa0 You have absolutely no idea, and then I think you're talking about the NBA, it's the greatest cover‑ups ever when you're talking about who they're picking.Ã‚Â\\xa0 They keep their cards really close to their chest.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I really had no idea, I just knew that I had faith that if I continued to work, I could possibly be in a position to be a top pick, but if I was to even fall to the 60th pick, I was going to be happy with trying to be in the greatest fraternity in the world, and that's the NBA.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 You're about to join a team that hasn't been to the playoffs in 11 years, and you're known for your postseason history in high school and this past season.Ã‚Â\\xa0 How big is it going to be to try and break that drought?  KARL‑ANTHONY TOWNS:Ã‚Â\\xa0 It's going to be very important to me.Ã‚Â\\xa0 That's going to be the main goal of the season for me, making the playoffs.Ã‚Â\\xa0 That's always going to be the main goal for me.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I mean, like you said, you know me from high school; we try to do our best work in the postseason.Ã‚Â\\xa0 We're going to work real hard right now in the summer, get everything straight, and we're going to make sure that we go into the season with the best possible team, with the best mindset and go out there and try to win and make it to the playoffs.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 You've done a lot of these interviews.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I'm sure you've talked about them a lot, as well.Ã‚Â\\xa0 One you did with the NBA, NBATV with D'Angelo Russell and Jahlil Okafor.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Tell me what it's been like to meet and greet obviously your competitors on the court, hopefully friends off it but soon to be competitors again.Ã‚Â\\xa0 What have you taken from those interactions?  KARL‑ANTHONY TOWNS:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I mean, it's just humility.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Before we're basketball players, we're humans, and we've got to respect each other, and we do that.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I think the greatest thing is the AAU has allowed us at an early age to really build better friendships with each other than before, and it allows us to build these friendships and let them to maturate over time.Ã‚Â\\xa0 That's why I think all of us, as you see, are really good friends off the court is because we know each other, and we've seen each other grow up, get stronger, bigger, quicker, better at the game of basketball, and we just respect each other tremendously.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 With seemingly probably everyone in this room presuming you were going to be the No.1 pick and you were the consensus No.1 pick, how did you put yourself in a mindset where you didn't take that for granted? KARL‑ANTHONY TOWNS:Ã‚Â\\xa0 You know what, when you've had the struggles like I've had in life, I just go by life, day by day, minute by minute, second by second, and I just enjoy every minute and second I'm on this earth.Ã‚Â\\xa0 That's how I do it.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I just went in the gym every day acting as if I was undrafted and I needed to work myself into the league.  That's how I'm going to continue to work.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I'm going to continue working as if‑‑ right now I'm just trying to get back to the league, and I'm going to continue working very hard so I can give my team the best version of myself.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 You're certainly going to be well compensated after tonight, but don't you wish you could have had the right to negotiate with all 30 employers like most Americans had instead of having a draft where you can only negotiate with one employer, if you had your druthers? KARL‑ANTHONY TOWNS:Ã‚Â\\xa0 That's the thing; sometimes in life, life is not fair.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Life has just never been fair from the get.Ã‚Â\\xa0 You know, I'm just happy with any card I was given today, whether it be from 2 to a jack.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I was going to be happy regardless.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I'm just happy that today is a day I can remember the rest of my life.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I'm just happy to have this moment to enjoy not only with my new future organization but with my family.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Is your stylist going to get you a nice winter coat up there? KARL‑ANTHONY TOWNS:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I'm not worried.Ã‚Â\\xa0 With the way she got this suit done, I'm not worried about a winter coat.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I wonder if you've talked to Anthony Davis or any of the other guys that were the first overall pick, and what sort of onus do you think goes with that, being the first guy?  KARL‑ANTHONY TOWNS: Ã‚Â\\xa0No, actually I haven't been able to talk to them.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I haven't been able to talk to them.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I've really just‑‑ I haven't been able to talk to anybody from previous years who have been the No.1 pick at the University of Kentucky, but I know the one thing I have to do is I have to live up to the expectations and goals and lofty expectations, again, that people are going to have for me for being the No.1 pick.Ã‚Â\\xa0 But through my life, there's always been expectations and goals set against me, and I've just always had to meet them and oversee them and also jump over the goals and the hurdles.  \"}, 'Satnam Singh Bhamara': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=110616', 'text': \"Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 One of the things I think the NBA is really focused on has been the overseas content, pushing the game in China, in other countries.Ã‚Â\\xa0 What do you think this means for kids who want to play basketball in India?Ã‚Â\\xa0 How does this show them that it's not just an American game, this is a global game?  SATNAM SINGH BHAMARA:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I think in India, like the last‑‑ sorry, one more time.  Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 How does this help the game of basketball in India for kids who want to play? SATNAM SINGH BHAMARA:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I think because in India, a lot of NBA coaches going over there and a lot of NBA players make it better for training.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I think the last couple years I watch every day in India.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I think it's a lot better because in India, no one plays for the NBA and no one is drafted.Ã‚Â\\xa0 That's why when I find out I'm in the NBA, in India there will be more better because there will be more people play basketball and more coaches going to India and make training a lot better.  Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 With the chance now to go to Dallas to play with players like Dirk Nowitzki, I can't help but think you're looking for that first chance to play H‑O‑R‑S‑E with him, shoot around with him?Ã‚Â\\xa0 What's it going to be like to play with a player of that caliber? SATNAM SINGH BHAMARA:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I do like to play shooting.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I do at my best friend's house.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Can you talk about watching Sim Bhullar make his debut this season, what that meant to you and whether that inspired you on your journey? SATNAM SINGH BHAMARA:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I met him the last couple of months, and I was, again, I think in San Antonio, over there, and he just told me keep playing hard and work hard over there.  I'm really happy because last couple of days I talk with him, he said, you are first Indian born to go play basketball in NBA.Ã‚Â\\xa0 He gave me a lot of experience in basketball, and he said just play hard and work hard over there.Ã‚Â\\xa0 That's why I followed everyone because I know he's Canadian but he's from India.Ã‚Â\\xa0 And I'm really excited for this because someone played for Canada and project for India, too.  He came to India for the last month, and there was a lot of people happy about me to him, and he made a lot better in India basketball, too.Ã‚Â\\xa0 He has a lot of fans in India, too, for like a symbol.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Do you recall the first NBA game you ever watched on TV?Ã‚Â\\xa0 And is there any player that you pattern your game after?  SATNAM SINGH BHAMARA:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I watched my first game in India like a couple of years ago, like 10 years ago, and I watched when Miami was against Lakers.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I watched Kobe Bryant, he played really good.Ã‚Â\\xa0 He work on post move, shooting, fake shot.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Then after that LeBron James, he did a good job with that, too.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I looked a lot for Kobe Bryant when I watched the first game.  Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Was there anybody that you base your game on?

D'ANGELO RUSSELL:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Man, I try to stand out wherever I go and be that star.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I'm just a kid from Louisville with a big heart, big dream, and to be in this position in that franchise, on the West Coast in one of the most beautiful cities in the world is a great opportunity to really take my game to the next level.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Obviously you're going to be playing with Kobe Bryant next year, a guy you grew up watching.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I know he's kind of towards the end of your career, but what is it going to be like to learn from him over the next year or two?  D'ANGELO RUSSELL:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Man, Kobe is a great dude, like you said.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Not knowing how much he has left in the tank is the scary thing, knowing how much he brings to the game, and if he leaves what we'll lose.Ã‚Â\\xa0 But I'm really looking forward to him taking me under his wing, if possible, and really just feeding me the knowledge, the most knowledge he can and just letting me use that as fire against my opponents.  Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Just talk about your Ohio State‑themed suit there a little bit.Ã‚Â\\xa0 What inspired that decision?  D'ANGELO RUSSELL:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Ohio State did a great job of recruiting me, one.Ã‚Â\\xa0 They was probably one of the first schools to give me the opportunity to go to college, bigger than basketball, to go to college to really get an education.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Thad Matta and his coaching staff, they were beautiful to me, and I really wanted to dedicate my suit to those that really played a huge part in it.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 A lot of people thought Okafor was going to go second.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Did you know ahead of time that the Lakers had settled on you?Ã‚Â\\xa0 And what was the reaction when you heard the news? D'ANGELO RUSSELL:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I didn't know at all.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I didn't know at all, man.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I'm still in shock.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I mean, you only can go by the rumors months ago that‑‑ what everybody was saying was going to happen.Ã‚Â\\xa0 But dreams come true, and life is not fair for people that don't agree to the decision that the front office made. Ã‚Â\\xa0But I'm here, and I'm ready to make an impact right away.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 We had a player here, D'Angelo is not a common first name, we had D'Angelo Harrison of St.John's.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I was wondering if you ever crossed paths at all.  D'ANGELO RUSSELL:Ã‚Â\\xa0 No, I don't know who that is.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 A lot of people thought you would fall to Philadelphia.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Are you glad you're not going to be part of that rebuilding process, something that seems to be‑‑ D'ANGELO RUSSELL:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Not at all.  Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Why not? D'ANGELO RUSSELL:Ã‚Â\\xa0 This is like a recruitment process all over again.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I definitely want to give them a praise for even taking the chance to look at me.Ã‚Â\\xa0 If I would have landed in Philly, it would have been a blessing.Ã‚Â\\xa0 If I would have landed in New York, if it would have been the 23rd team, I would have been satisfied.

Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 What was your reaction to hearing the fans' boos?Ã‚Â\\xa0 They didn't seem happy with the pick.  KRISTAPS PORZINGIS:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I mean, a lot of fans weren't happy that they drafted me, but I have to do everything that's in my hands to turn those booing fans into clapping fans.  There's nothing I can do.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I was happy about it.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I want to be a part of this organization, and I know the fans are a little harsh sometimes, but that's how it is here in New York, and I'm ready for it.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 In what ways do you think your game fits with Carmelo Anthony's?  KRISTAPS PORZINGIS:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I think Carmelo is a great player.Ã‚Â\\xa0 He makes players around him better.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Whatever theme, whatever Carmelo wants me to do, I will do that out on the court just to prove that I'm worthy enough to be on the court with him, starting with the dirty jobs; just getting rebounds, getting shots, getting blocks and just running the court.Ã‚Â\\xa0 We will have time to practice with each other and hopefully I will be able to fit in with Carmelo.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Did any other teams look at you?Ã‚Â\\xa0 And if so, do you think you could be traded to one of those teams?  KRISTAPS PORZINGIS:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I'm not sure about that.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Obviously always there's a chance you get drafted, you get traded after you get drafted.Ã‚Â\\xa0 But for me, that's not my job really.Ã‚Â\\xa0 That's what my agent does.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I really don't have much information.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 What are you looking forward most playing here in New York? KRISTAPS PORZINGIS:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Thank you.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Just being here in New York, just the fans, Madison Square Garden, such a historic place.Ã‚Â\\xa0 For me it's an honor to be a part of this organization, and I just can't wait to let the season start and just get to work.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 When you worked for the Knicks, did they specifically go over aspects of the triangle offense?Ã‚Â\\xa0 And how do you think you could fit into that system? KRISTAPS PORZINGIS:Ã‚Â\\xa0 We did a little bit, but I still have a lot of learning to do.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I know the basics of triangle offense.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I'm not ready to be on the court yet, knowing all the little details about triangle offense, but for me I don't think it'll be a problem to adjust to that offense.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I think it's a good offense; you just move a lot and there's always spacing.Ã‚Â\\xa0 So I'm looking forward to learning that offense.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I'm curious to know since you come from a Baltic state what your favorite player from your native country is.  KRISTAPS PORZINGIS:Ã‚Â\\xa0 When Andris Biedrins was still playing, he was my favorite player.Ã‚Â\\xa0 He had a great career‑‑ for a few years he had a great career.Ã‚Â\\xa0 He was playing high level basketball and he was a guy I looked up to, so hopefully now I can be that guy in Latvia for kids to look up to.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 The Knicks are coming off their worst season in franchise history, 17 wins.Ã‚Â\\xa0 How can a Kristaps Porzingis turn the Knicks around?  KRISTAPS PORZINGIS:Ã‚Â\\xa0 It's hard to say for me right now.Ã‚Â\\xa0 You know, I didn't know where I was going to be, so I haven't really thought about how I can impact the team since the first moment.Ã‚Â\\xa0 But obviously I will be there, do my job, first, play as hard as possible. Ã‚Â\\xa0I heard New York fans and people in New York are hard‑working fans, so they want to see players work hard on the court.Ã‚Â\\xa0 That's the first thing I've got to do.Ã‚Â\\xa0 As a young guy I've got to bring energy, and hopefully we can turn this around.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Kristaps, the sound bites will be about the booing, etcetera, but do you think it's a disadvantage European players have over their American college player counterparts because we don't know as much about European player? KRISTAPS PORZINGIS:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Yeah, I think American fans, they know more college guys than guys overseas.Ã‚Â\\xa0 But my agent did a great job of putting my name out there in the news and having a lot of interviews and media stuff, so the people in New York and all over America can get to know me better.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I think more and more fans are getting to know me better now.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Can you describe what your conversation with Phil Jackson was like at the workout, and what were the one or two things he said to you that struck you as most interesting or profound?  KRISTAPS PORZINGIS:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Can you repeat that, please?   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 What was your conversation like with Phil Jackson at the workout and what were some of the things he told you that you remembered that struck you as interesting?  KRISTAPS PORZINGIS:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I mean, what we talked about was a little bit of triangle offense, how it works.Ã‚Â\\xa0 He just wanted to explain it to me a little bit.Ã‚Â\\xa0 He asked me questions about basketball.Ã‚Â\\xa0 He just wanted to know my IQ level of basketball, and that was basically it.Ã‚Â\\xa0 It was a good conversation.  I can tell Phil is such a legendary guy, he does everything.Ã‚Â\\xa0 It's obviously a blessing to be able to play for him and just be in his team.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Knowing the importance of this pick, how does it feel to get this kind of vote of confidence from Phil Jackson?  KRISTAPS PORZINGIS:Ã‚Â\\xa0 It's crazy, you know, for me, just playing in New York.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Phil Jackson is a known hero.Ã‚Â\\xa0 First I'll make sure I do my work, and he'll make sure he puts me in a position where I can succeed.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Really looking forward to it, and I'm just very happy to be here in New York.  \"}, 'Bobby Portis': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=110608', 'text': \"Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 You mentioned having to sit there.Ã‚Â\\xa0 There was some talk about you maybe at 15, some talk about you in the top 10.Ã‚Â\\xa0 What was that emotion like when it didn't happen?Ã‚Â\\xa0 And talk about the emotions of being in Chicago.Ã‚Â\\xa0 It's a loaded front court.Ã‚Â\\xa0 How do you fit there? BOBBY PORTIS:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I wasn't mad, but I was nervous all the way from 11 to 22.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I was just nervous because I didn't know when I was going to hear my name.Ã‚Â\\xa0 But then I finally figured it out.Ã‚Â\\xa0 My agent told me that Milwaukee was going to trade up and they was going to get Rashad Vaughn, so that was out of the loop.Ã‚Â\\xa0 And then he said that Washington was going to take Jerian Grant, so I was like, yeah, that's out of the loop.  I didn't work out for Toronto, and I think it was Dallas at 21, I didn't work out for neither of those.Ã‚Â\\xa0 So like after that, I kind of knew I was going to be a Bull.  Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 You've been an Arkansas guy your whole life, what is it going to be like to go to the big city, Chicago, and kind of get outside of your comfort zone? BOBBY PORTIS:Ã‚Â\\xa0 It's not going to be hard because these past two months I was in Chicago working out and I stayed there for two months, and I kind of got like a great feel for the city.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I was there from April to June, so I thought it was cool to just go there and work out with Mark Bartelstein's group and even Sam Dekker was there working out with me.Ã‚Â\\xa0 So it was cool just to go there and work out.  I've been in Arkansas for 20 years and I think it'll be a big step for me to move out of Arkansas, but that's something that all kids have to deal with.  Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 What are you looking forward to in terms of playing with Derrick Rose? BOBBY PORTIS:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Just trying to open up the floor a little bit more.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Just trying to make it more spaced out there so our bigs won't be cluttered in the paint.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I feel like they'll need someone to step out and hit jumpers.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I feel like I'm the player that can do it all.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I don't do anything great they say, but I do a lot of good things.Ã‚Â\\xa0 So for that instance I can come in and just make an instant impact, I think.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Jimmy Butler plays for the Chicago Bulls, much improved offensive player.Ã‚Â\\xa0 You're also a pretty good offensive player.Ã‚Â\\xa0 How excited are you about playing with Jimmy Butler who's much improved offensively? BOBBY PORTIS:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Oh, very excited.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I feel like Jimmy Butler plays with the same energy that I do.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Every time I step on the basketball court, I try to go as hard as I can, and I feel like Jimmy Butler and Taj Gibson and everyone else does the same thing.Ã‚Â\\xa0 So I think I complement them very well.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Unlike some of the teams earlier in the lottery, the Bulls give you a chance to win right away.Ã‚Â\\xa0 What do you think you bring to the locker room and what do you think you bring in terms of skill set? BOBBY PORTIS:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Low‑maintenance guy, high character.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I'm a guy that's always won everywhere.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I didn't win a National Championship in college, but I got my team farther than they've been in nine years.Ã‚Â\\xa0 So I've always won.Ã‚Â\\xa0 In high school I won four state championships and in college I got my team as far as I could.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I'm just a winner, so I think I can just bring a winning culture to the franchise.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 You won four state championships.Ã‚Â\\xa0 You were also kind of a key player on every team that you've been on.Ã‚Â\\xa0 What kind of adjustment is that going to be to be more of a role player, especially to start out? BOBBY PORTIS:Ã‚Â\\xa0 If you think about it, I feel like all role players are key players.Ã‚Â\\xa0 The role players are the guys that does all the blue‑collar stuff for the superstars to rise.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Role players are key players, too.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I feel like eventually I can work my way up to being a starter.Ã‚Â\\xa0 That's my main goal is to try to be the best Bobby Portis I can be in the NBA?   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 How is it working with Coach Williamson, your AAU coach?Ã‚Â\\xa0 Is he giving you any good advice, getting you ready for the NBA? BOBBY PORTIS:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Yeah, no doubt.Ã‚Â\\xa0 He always told me, just stay in shape because he said that the college games are over in mid‑January, and in the NBA that's 30‑some games then.Ã‚Â\\xa0 So he said, it's an 82‑game schedule, eat the right things, get your rest because I'm a guy that stays up a little late.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I don't party or anything, I just can't sleep.Ã‚Â\\xa0 That's me.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I stay up until 12:00, 1:00, and I get like five, six hours of sleep, so I've got to start getting more sleep now.Ã‚Â\\xa0 So that's going to be something that's big for me, trying to get to bed and things. Some of the other things he said is he said just watch out for family members coming out of nowhere asking for things because you have a little money in your pocket now.Ã‚Â\\xa0 That's one thing he always said.   Q. Ã‚Â\\xa0With Fred Hoiberg coming in, how do you feel like your style of game fits in with the up‑tempo style? BOBBY PORTIS:Ã‚Â\\xa0 That's something that I always played in.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Every team that I played with always played in an up‑tempo style.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Even Arkansas, that's I flourished because I ran the pick‑and‑roll, ran the pick‑and‑pop game.Ã‚Â\\xa0 That's something that I think Fred Hoiberg does well with his bigs.Ã‚Â\\xa0 He puts his bigs in a different type of situation than most coaches would.Ã‚Â\\xa0 He makes his bigs play and just read and react off their instincts.  \"}, 'Cameron Payne': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=110601', 'text': 'Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 What has Oklahoma City said to you? CAMERON PAYNE:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Man, when they called me name, I was looking at the guy from Yahoo\\'s site, man, and I seen \"Cameron Payne\" come up, and I was thanking God.  But I was shocked that they picked me.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I was thinking I was going to go earlier, but man, God put me in the perfect fit.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Everything happened for a reason.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I\\'m glad Oklahoma City gave me that chance, and I\\'m going to make the best out of my opportunity.Ã‚Â\\xa0 That\\'s what happened at Murray, and that\\'s what I\\'m going to do at Oklahoma City.  Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Are you going to put your name on the map in Oklahoma City? CAMERON PAYNE:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I\\'m definitely going to put my name on the map, \"Cam‑Payne\" (laughing).   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 You just mentioned everything happens for a reason.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Tonight is a huge moment, so really congratulations there, but I want to talk about some of the tougher moments from this year.Ã‚Â\\xa0 You guys had, Murray State, you\\'re known for big long win streaks the last couple years, running numbers up into the 30s.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Tell me about some of those tough losses at the end of the year.  CAMERON PAYNE:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I mean, it\\'s all good.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Well, the first one we played at Belmont, I felt that that was a test when we lost that game.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I felt it was a test.Ã‚Â\\xa0 We went into the locker room, my coach said, \"We\\'re not going to define ourselves over nine seconds.\"Ã‚Â\\xa0 After he said that, it was time to get to work.Ã‚Â\\xa0 We had to go into the NIT praying that we were getting to the NCAA Tournament.Ã‚Â\\xa0 But we ended up going to the NIT.Ã‚Â\\xa0 That\\'s a big tournament, too.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Our goal was to get to Madison Square Garden.  Then we played Old Dominion at Old Dominion.Ã‚Â\\xa0 They gave us a tough shot, Trey Freeman, a heck of a player; he shot a great shot and made it.Ã‚Â\\xa0 My team and I, man, we did enough.  We did enough to get me to this point, and I guess, man, it wasn\\'t meant to be tore me to go to Madison Square Garden.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I guess it was just meant for me to play with Oklahoma City and play at Madison Square Garden.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Kind of two things right here:Ã‚Â\\xa0 First off, out of the guys that got picked in the lottery you might be the best situation of anyone.Ã‚Â\\xa0 What does it mean to you to be in that situation?Ã‚Â\\xa0 And then Murray State, you guys have been pretty good the last couple years, but what does it mean to be coming from a mid‑major? CAMERON PAYNE:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Well, first thing the last time Russell Westbrook and Kevin Durant played together, they was in the championship.Ã‚Â\\xa0 So I\\'m blessed to be a part of that team, and I\\'m going to be ready.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I\\'m looking forward for us to get back there, and I\\'m looking forward to being a part of that.  I mean, like you mentioned, all those teams, it\\'s kind of funny when I looked at the green room list, every single one of those teams, and you had Murray State, the lone mid‑major.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I was blessed I was put in that position, and it\\'s crazy, to have Murray State right there between Kentucky and all those‑‑ most every team, they were in the Final Four, Elite 8.Ã‚Â\\xa0 And we didn\\'t even get to the Final Four of the NIT.  I mean, it\\'s a blessing in disguise to have me here.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I\\'m big time guy on trust the process.Ã‚Â\\xa0 So I mean, I guess that\\'s why God put me here, for me to share my story and for me to share my experience and let everyone latch onto it and hear it.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Growing up I know you played the point guard position.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Did you have a favorite point guard that you liked to watch growing up? CAMERON PAYNE:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Growing up I watched a lot of guys.Ã‚Â\\xa0 The main one was Tony Parker.Ã‚Â\\xa0 He\\'s a winner.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I grew up being a winner.Ã‚Â\\xa0 When I lost, tough time.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Very tough time.Ã‚Â\\xa0 But I watched Tony Parker, man.Ã‚Â\\xa0 He controlled his team the best out of any point guard in the league.Ã‚Â\\xa0 You can tell by the amount of championships that he keeps getting.  But he controls his team, and him and Tim Duncan, man, they\\'re the leaders of that team, and I put myself in that leadership role.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I feel I do the same thing that that guy does, and I just want to get better at those things.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 You did mention that you thought you would go earlier and you went 14.Ã‚Â\\xa0 What were you feeling after every team was picking and you just landed with OKC? CAMERON PAYNE:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Man, after the first 10, every team that was left were teams that I was high on their list, so I mean, I was nervous.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I got real nervous when 11 came, then 12 came, then 13, because all those team had me high.Ã‚Â\\xa0 But as a point guard, you can\\'t go up and down.Ã‚Â\\xa0 You\\'ve got to stay level.  So I mean, I was very confident, and I just stayed the course, and I just‑‑ like I\\'ve been saying, I just trusted the process, and I mean, now I\\'m going to Oklahoma City, and that\\'s where I\\'m supposed to be.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 You talked a lot this week about how you have a mentality where you feel like you can play on the court with anybody.Ã‚Â\\xa0 How does that translate to a practice court that you will share with Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook? CAMERON PAYNE:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I\\'m looking forward to it.Ã‚Â\\xa0 They\\'re going to make me a better player 100 percent.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I\\'m going in and I\\'m trying to get better.Ã‚Â\\xa0 That\\'s the main thing.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Trying to get better every single day, and me going to Oklahoma City going up against those guys, that\\'s what\\'s going to happen for me.  Like I\\'ve been saying, God did it for a reason.Ã‚Â\\xa0 That just may be the reason, for me to bloom and for me to learn and for me to groom into a better player.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 You talked about being a point guard, you talked yesterday about how you love putting scorers in the right position.Ã‚Â\\xa0 You\\'re going to a team with guys that like to dominate the ball like Russell and Kevin.Ã‚Â\\xa0 What else can you bring to the Thunder? CAMERON PAYNE:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Man, I can be a combo guard.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I can be a shooting guard.Ã‚Â\\xa0 On my team at Murray I rarely had to score the ball.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I was down there on the ball.  But anything the coach needs me to do, Cameron Payne is going to do it.Ã‚Â\\xa0 There\\'s no way I\\'m going to be a selfish guy.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I\\'m a point guard, I\\'m the most unselfish player on the court.Ã‚Â\\xa0 If I\\'m needed to play the 2, if I\\'m needed to play the 5, I\\'m going to do it.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 What can you take from Russell Westbrook\\'s game that you think will make you a better player? CAMERON PAYNE:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Stop shooting floaters and start shooting mid‑range jump shots.Ã‚Â\\xa0 That\\'s going to be a main thing.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Man, he stops and pops great.Ã‚Â\\xa0 He\\'s got one of the best mid‑range games in the league right now.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I need to add that to my game instead of shooting the floater all the time.Ã‚Â\\xa0 So that\\'s going to be one of the major aspects that I can add to my game.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 You talked about Russell Westbrook.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Who\\'s a better dresser, you or him?  CAMERON PAYNE:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Ooh, you\\'re already trying to start beef (laughing).Ã‚Â\\xa0 I mean, he\\'s got to be‑‑ on different levels.Ã‚Â\\xa0 On different levels.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I\\'m just going to go half and half.Ã‚Â\\xa0 We\\'re just going to go half and half because sometimes I can be a bit spiffy, but sometimes he can like, man, he fresh.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I say about 50/50, but I\\'ve got to give it to him, you know.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 You\\'ve played at a small college and now you\\'re going to Oklahoma City.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Was there ever a part of you that said, I\\'d like to play in the Big Ten or play in a big market just for your own experience? CAMERON PAYNE:Ã‚Â\\xa0 In the NBA?   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Or college.  CAMERON PAYNE:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I mean, growing up, I mean, I wanted to go to Duke University, but I mean, that\\'s not the path that was chosen for me.Ã‚Â\\xa0 But I mean, I felt if I were to play at a bigger college, I would have been noticed earlier.Ã‚Â\\xa0 But I guessseeing them in the green room right now, so it was meant for me to go to a mid‑major and get known late.  But I mean, I take it Murray State is just like Oklahoma City, a small town, and it\\'s all about work.Ã‚Â\\xa0 It\\'s all about getting in the gym and doing what\\'s best for the team and putting your heart out for the organization every day.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Your name has been associated with the Thunder for a while now.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Have you been in touch with either coach Billy Donovan, Durant, Westbrook, anyone? CAMERON PAYNE:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I definitely talked to Billy, and I definitely talked to Sam, Sam Presti.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Sam is my guy.Ã‚Â\\xa0 We talked a lot when I went down there and met with them I think two weeks ago maybe.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I had a blast down there in OKC.  It\\'s a big‑time step for Murray, I\\'ll tell you that.Ã‚Â\\xa0 It\\'s a big‑time step for Murray.Ã‚Â\\xa0 It\\'s going to be a good town for me.  '}, 'Kelly Oubre': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=110614', 'text': \"Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Can you just kind of walk us through the course of events tonight.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I know it was kind of get drafted, that's an emotional high, then find out you get traded.Ã‚Â\\xa0 How did everything go down? KELLY OUBRE:Ã‚Â\\xa0 It hasn't been bad for me.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I got traded but it was kind of in the flow of things.Ã‚Â\\xa0 When I got drafted by the Hawks, I was already told that the Wizards were trying to make a move on me, so I was already ready for it.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I just had to sit in the holding room until the whole trade got finalized, but I'm here now and I'm wearing the hat proudly.  Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 What do you like about the Wizards and how you fit in with them? KELLY OUBRE:Ã‚Â\\xa0 They have two young stars who are still making their way through the league.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I definitely feel like I can learn from them, play with them, and we can be successful together.  By me doing so, coming in, I feel like I bring a lot to the team, I bring a lot to the table, and I'm just ready to get to work and help this team win.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Can you tell us what your expectations were going into tonight, and also what do you think are your best assets?Ã‚Â\\xa0 What do you bring to the table? KELLY OUBRE:Ã‚Â\\xa0 You know, my expectation was to go top 10.Ã‚Â\\xa0 It doesn't work out like that for everybody, but I still feel like I'm one of the best players in this draft.Ã‚Â\\xa0 My confidence is through the roof but I'm humble, also.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I know I have a lot to work and I'm ready to work on those things to help my team be the best that it can be.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I've been through some bumps and bruises in college, I'm going to go through some bumps and bruises in the NBA.  I'm just ready to put this Wizards jersey on and wear it with pride and help the team win.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I want to win a championship and I feel like I bring a lot to the table, and I can help my team do so.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Talking about what you bring to the table, can you talk about your story, your path here.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I don't know how many people know your career, your history to get here.Ã‚Â\\xa0 There's a lot going on coming from New Orleans.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Tell me about what your family taught you coming up.  KELLY OUBRE:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Yeah, like you said, I was born in New Orleans.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Lived in New Orleans for nine years.Ã‚Â\\xa0 When I was nine I moved to Houston because of Hurricane Katrina kind of ruined the city a little bit.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I evacuated to Houston and my dad just decided he was going to keep me in Houston because they had better resources.Ã‚Â\\xa0 By him doing that, that was another sacrifice.Ã‚Â\\xa0 He left his job and we went through a little struggle through a point of time where we were living in hotels and cars.  If it weren't for that time, long story short, I wouldn't be here today because that put a chip on my shoulder, and it allowed me to realize that everything that I've ever loved and had could be gone in a split second.Ã‚Â\\xa0 My family was moved around.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I didn't see my mom for about two months.Ã‚Â\\xa0 My little brother was a baby.Ã‚Â\\xa0 He was just born a couple years before that.  That time was pretty hectic in my life and my parents had divorced.Ã‚Â\\xa0 So by them being split up we went separate paths.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I thought I lost them.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I didn't hear from them for a week or so.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I always think about that on the court.Ã‚Â\\xa0 That's what gives me my drive to want to be the best that I can be.Ã‚Â\\xa0 At this next level ‑‑ I've always felt like I've been slept on, and I'm ready to wake people up.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I'm motivated and I'm a worker, and I want to be the best that I can be at this next level.

JAHLIL OKAFOR:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I wasn't shocked.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I knew I was going to be going to the NBA tonight.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I was going to be a top‑five pick, no matter what happened.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I wasn't shocked.  Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 How can you guys make this happen?Ã‚Â\\xa0 For three years in a row the Sixers drafted a center.Ã‚Â\\xa0 You guys all need the ball.Ã‚Â\\xa0 How can you make this happen? JAHLIL OKAFOR:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I don't know, it's not my job to figure out.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I'll just go there and work as hard as I can.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Big journey for you; you've worked really hard to get to this point.Ã‚Â\\xa0 How did you become such a skilled low‑post player? JAHLIL OKAFOR:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I think it started with me just always being the tallest player in my age group, which pretty much right away had all the coaches send me right to the block.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I've been playing basketball my entire life, and my entire life I've been the tallest guy, and with that being said I've always been in the post.  I just got really comfortable in the post.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I worked on my craft and watched a lot of film.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 How familiar are you yourself with Philly?Ã‚Â\\xa0 I think one of the things that's neat about the Sports Pavilion, they've got all their teams close to one another.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I'm curious your thoughts what that shows about Philly and sports in that city? JAHLIL OKAFOR:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I'm not too familiar with Philadelphia.Ã‚Â\\xa0 One of my teammates at Duke University, Amile Jefferson, is from there, and always talking about it's the best city and all that other stuff.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I'm from Chicago, so we always argue.Ã‚Â\\xa0 But I'm excited to get to know the city a little better.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 For a long time you were the consensus No.1 player in the nation, a lot of people had you going No.1 overall for many, many months.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Now going No.3 overall, does that kind of put a chip on your shoulder, disappoint you at all?Ã‚Â\\xa0 How do you feel about that fact? JAHLIL OKAFOR:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I can't be disappointed.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I'm in the NBA living my dream.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I've been getting a lot of criticism.Ã‚Â\\xa0 People in my circle, we're just going to take it with a grain of salt.Ã‚Â\\xa0 It's easy to shoot at somebody when they're at the top of the hill.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I've been pretty much at the top all throughout high school, all throughout college, so I'm expecting it.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 What was your dialogue with the Lakers?Ã‚Â\\xa0 Did they give you any expectation at all that they were really interested in you?Ã‚Â\\xa0 And in that sense were you surprised that they went a different direction? JAHLIL OKAFOR:Ã‚Â\\xa0 No, they never gave me any answer, as much as we tried to get an answer from Minnesota, as much as we tried to get an answer from the Lakers, nobody ever answered.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I didn't know what to expect.Ã‚Â\\xa0 It was hard for me to go to sleep last night.  Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I was intrigued to hear you talk about being the tallest player, being sent to the post.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Some people regard being sent to the post as almost being sent to the principal's office or something.Ã‚Â\\xa0 When you're alone in the gym working out, what shots do you take that you enjoy working on outside of the structure of an organized team situation? JAHLIL OKAFOR:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I shoot all kinds of shots.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I don't just stay on the block and just do lay‑ups and dunk when I'm in the gym by myself.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I shoot a lot of bank shots, a lot of shots around the perimeter.Ã‚Â\\xa0 There's a lot of things I like to work on, but I know my bread and butter when it comes down to it is in the post.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 You're known as a low‑post scorer, and that's what people talk the most about.Ã‚Â\\xa0 What other things do you think you do especially well on the court?  JAHLIL OKAFOR:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I think I'm a great teammate.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I became a better talker on the floor, being at Duke, being in leadership with Coach K, and I think I got better defensively as the season progressed.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I've been working on all aspects of my game.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Is that kind of a retro Motown look you were going for tonight? JAHLIL OKAFOR:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I had a lot of help.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Thank you for the compliment, but I had a lot of help.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Didn't have much time these past two months to come up with a draft suit, so I had somebody help me.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Obviously there are a lot of low‑post players on the Sixers team and you being a low‑post player, there's a chance you might have to work on extending your range a little bit out to the perimeter.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Is that something you're comfortable with, something you've already been working on? JAHLIL OKAFOR:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I've been playing basketball my entire life, so I feel comfortable doing what I'm asked of.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Like I said, my bread and butter is in the post.Ã‚Â\\xa0 That's where I've always been and there's where I'm most effective.  Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Is there a post player you pattern your game after, number one?Ã‚Â\\xa0 And number two, are you comfortable with the rebuilding process that could take a long time, maybe being the centerpiece of it at this point? JAHLIL OKAFOR:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I'm definitely used to being the centerpiece of a team.Ã‚Â\\xa0 That's what I've become accustomed to.Ã‚Â\\xa0 That's what I've been working so hard for.Ã‚Â\\xa0 But there are two guys that play my position that I enjoy watching and that's Tim Duncan and also Hakeem Olajuwon.  Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 You mentioned Coach K.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Is there anything you can tell us, any advice he gave you to help make the transition to the NBA?  JAHLIL OKAFOR:Ã‚Â\\xa0 One thing he said, make sure that my heart was in it. Ã‚Â\\xa0He felt the type of person I was, if I was going to do something, then my heart had to be in it.Ã‚Â\\xa0 If that was the case, then I would go all out.Ã‚Â\\xa0 So that was one piece of advice he gave me. \"}, 'Emmanuel Mudiyai': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=110604', 'text': \"Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Landing in Denver at 7, but there were talks maybe 2, maybe 4.Ã‚Â\\xa0 To kind of slide a little bit but to land where you landed, what were the emotions like and how do you feel?

EMMANUEL MUDIAY:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I don't think it impacted, I just think maybe when I got hurt.Ã‚Â\\xa0 You could have got hurt anywhere, so when I got hurt I think that's what made the stock go down, I guess you want to say.Ã‚Â\\xa0 But I'm in the NBA, I made it in, so it starts right now.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Everybody that got drafted, we've still got a lot to prove.  Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Since you're kind of an unknown commodity, what do you feel like you're going to bring to the NBA and to the Denver Nuggets? EMMANUEL MUDIAY:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I just want to win as many championships as I can win.Ã‚Â\\xa0 The league is about winning.Ã‚Â\\xa0 When you win, everything else takes care of itself.Ã‚Â\\xa0 What I can bring is just my competitive spirit and try to bring it both sides of the floor, defense and offense.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 A little bit about Denver, sister city in China is Kunming.Ã‚Â\\xa0 What are you going to try to do to get Denver over there to play some preseason games? EMMANUEL MUDIAY:Ã‚Â\\xa0 That's out of my control.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I think that's the team's decision.Ã‚Â\\xa0 But if they want to go play in China, I would love to go back over there and play.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I've got a great fan base over there, and regardless if they go back or not, I'm going to go back myself just to show my appreciation and the love that they showed me.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 One of the guys you played with over in China, Will Bynum, I'm curious if you could tell me what you learned from him as a guard taking a backseat role and then obviously playing alongside him in the playoffs.Ã‚Â\\xa0 What did he tell you the days you were on the bench? EMMANUEL MUDIAY:Ã‚Â\\xa0 He helped me a lot.Ã‚Â\\xa0 He told me how to carry yourself when things aren't going your way and when things are going your way.Ã‚Â\\xa0 It's not an easy league.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Things go up and down, but you've just got to keep a positive mindset, keep working hard and just show a great attitude.Ã‚Â\\xa0 That's really what he taught me.  Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 And keep good family around you.  EMMANUEL MUDIAY:Ã‚Â\\xa0 That too.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 What do you know about the Denver Nuggets' roster and the guys you'll be playing with there? EMMANUEL MUDIAY:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I know Kenneth Faried and Ty Lawson.Ã‚Â\\xa0 That's the two main people that all of us know.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Those are the two guys that really stand out on the team.Ã‚Â\\xa0 That's what I know about them so far.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I can just learn as much as I can from Ty Lawson.Ã‚Â\\xa0 He's been there a while, so I'm just going to try to get as much advice as I can.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 What do you need to improve on to gel with Ty Lawson in the backcourt? EMMANUEL MUDIAY:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Probably just be more of a consistent shooter.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I'm confident in my shot, but it wouldn't hurt‑‑ anybody would want to shoot like Steph Curry.Ã‚Â\\xa0 So just keep working on my shot, keep being consistent.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Going to college, playing in the Tournament, that's an experience, but playing in a different country, language barrier, cultural barrier, do you feel like that gives you a leg up on the mental game? EMMANUEL MUDIAY:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Definitely.Ã‚Â\\xa0 You're out there playing with grown men.Ã‚Â\\xa0 You're out there playing with a shot clock and basically NBA rules.Ã‚Â\\xa0 That's really what it is.Ã‚Â\\xa0 The only thing is the three‑second rule probably is the only thing that's different about the China League, CBA League.Ã‚Â\\xa0 But as far as playing with grown men, the physicality over there is ridiculous; it's like playoff basketball.  So that's one thing that really helped me, and I feel like I do have an advantage coming in and playing a professional type of basketball thing already.  \"}, 'Jordan Mickey': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=110613', 'text': 'Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 You have great physical attributes.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Will those attributes help you guard LeBron James and Kevin Durant?

Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 How do you see yourself fitting within Brad Stevens\\' system? JORDAN MICKEY:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I see myself fitting in well get up‑and‑down a little bit half court and run a play and get what they want.  Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 What kind of familiarity do you have with the current players on the team or anybody on the coaching staff? JORDAN MICKEY:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Jared Sullinger I watched him work out a few times at Ohio State, actually when he was going through the pre‑draft process.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Guys just got drafted, Terry Rozier, I\\'ve been through quite a few workouts with him.Ã‚Â\\xa0 We talked a little bit.Ã‚Â\\xa0 R.J. Hunter, I don\\'t know him too much, but definitely good friends with Marcus Smart.Ã‚Â\\xa0 He\\'s another Dallas guy.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I played against him quite a bit.Ã‚Â\\xa0 So those guys I know.  Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 What kind of relationship do you have with Marcus?  JORDAN MICKEY:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I\\'d say we\\'re pretty close.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Definitely when we see each other we always talk a lot, laugh.Ã‚Â\\xa0 So I feel we have a pretty good relationship.

CHRIS McCULLOUGH:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I watched them every time they play.  Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 What were your impressions of them last year? CHRIS McCULLOUGH:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Honestly I watched one person; I watched Plumlee because he plays the same position.Ã‚Â\\xa0 So I see exactly what he did and try to have my game just like him.  Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 You grew up here on the streets of Brooklyn, or the Bronx? CHRIS McCULLOUGH:Ã‚Â\\xa0 From the Bronx.  Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Did your uncle or your father have anything to do with basketball?  CHRIS McCULLOUGH:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Yeah, my whole family played basketball.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I come from a basketball family.Ã‚Â\\xa0 My father went to Murray State.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Both my uncles played at Pitt.  Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 You're recovering from an ACL injury.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Where are you as far as your progress there?Ã‚Â\\xa0 And are you going to be able to play next season? CHRIS McCULLOUGH:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I should be able to play by November.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I'm not going to rush it.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I'm just waiting my time, that's it.  Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 How frustrating was the injury?Ã‚Â\\xa0 And was there ever a chance that you were going to return to Syracuse and maybe try to improve your draft ranking? CHRIS McCULLOUGH:Ã‚Â\\xa0 It was very frustrating at first, maybe the first week, week and a half.Ã‚Â\\xa0 After that I got over it pretty fast.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I had to come back stronger, be stronger, overall game got even better.Ã‚Â\\xa0 So that's what I focused on doing.  Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 What do you feel like is the best part of your game?Ã‚Â\\xa0 What do you have to work on at the next level?Ã‚Â\\xa0  CHRIS McCULLOUGH:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Best part of my game is rebounding, playing defense.Ã‚Â\\xa0 And I just want to work on my overall game, my body, and be the best player I can be.  Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 After you got drafted, I saw you spoke with Lionel Hollins for a little bit.Ã‚Â\\xa0 What did he say to you? CHRIS McCULLOUGH:Ã‚Â\\xa0 The main thing that stuck out to me was in the interview process, because I couldn't play in the Combine.Ã‚Â\\xa0 So nobody could see me play.Ã‚Â\\xa0 So my interview was pretty good, he said, and that's what got them to pick me.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Once you are healthy enough to play full‑time, what could a Chris McCullough bring to the Brooklyn Nets? CHRIS McCULLOUGH:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Rebounding, a person who's going to play defense, play real hard and just run the floor and play my game.  Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I know this is your hometown, your hometown team and you and your family had thought about playing here.Ã‚Â\\xa0 What was it like to hear your name with the Nets? CHRIS McCULLOUGH:Ã‚Â\\xa0 It's amazing.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I am from New York City.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I'm from the Bronx.Ã‚Â\\xa0 So being called to play for the Brooklyn Nets is a big thing for me to have that opportunity, so I'm blessed for that.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 You talked about the interview process.Ã‚Â\\xa0 What was asked and what did you say that maybe impressed them so much? CHRIS McCULLOUGH:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I don't know, I think we just connected.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Once we got in the room together we connected.Ã‚Â\\xa0 He gave me life lessons, so basically that's the main thing right there.  Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 You weren't able to work out during the off‑season like other individuals, so how do you feel that you got to this point without working out with these teams? CHRIS McCULLOUGH:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I thought that I interviewed pretty well with every time.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Just being around the Combine, watching them play basketball, just trying to learn a lot of things and try and pick out little things from everybody's game.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Where are you in the rehab process in terms of running and jumping?Ã‚Â\\xa0 Can you give me an update on that? CHRIS McCULLOUGH:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Right now I'm exactly four and a half months out.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I just started running three weeks ago and I started jumping maybe three weeks ago.Ã‚Â\\xa0 So it's coming along pretty good.  Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 They said you'll be back on track playing basketball in November?

TREY LYLES:Ã‚Â\\xa0 It\\'s great, being able to be a part of this with six other guys that we\\'ve been with, that I\\'ve been with for a year of my life, and that this is the ultimate dream of all of ours, and just being able to be a part of it with them is great.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Everybody believes in one another and we all know each other are going to be successful no matter what we do.  Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Was it a bit of a swing there back to back, you have the hometown Pacers pick right before you go, they pick somebody else, and then almost immediately, though, you get the high of being picked next?Ã‚Â\\xa0 Was there a little bit of a swing there? TREY LYLES:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Not at all.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Like I said previous days and months ago, I\\'m going to be thankful for wherever I go, and it just happens to be Utah, so I\\'m very thankful about that.  Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 How much have you been to Utah?Ã‚Â\\xa0 What sort of impression do you have of that area?  TREY LYLES:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I\\'ve been to Utah a few times for different camps, and of course working out with the team.Ã‚Â\\xa0 It\\'s a very small town, but it\\'s a nice town, and it\\'s very close knit.Ã‚Â\\xa0 They support the team out there, so I\\'m thankful for that.  Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I realize that you\\'re 6\\'10\" but you\\'re able to put the ball on the floor.Ã‚Â\\xa0 How is someone so tall so versatile and agile at the same time? TREY LYLES:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Just a lot of work, years of work practicing, being in the gym, not limiting myself to just one position and being able to do more than one thing.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I have to thank my father for that for working with me when I was young.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Going to Utah first, what do you know about that team in particular?Ã‚Â\\xa0 Where do you feel like you fit in? TREY LYLES:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I know it\\'s a young team.Ã‚Â\\xa0 They just drafted Exum last year.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I know Alec Burks personally.Ã‚Â\\xa0 He was one of my coaches when I was younger for a camp that I went to.Ã‚Â\\xa0 And then Gordon Hayward being from Indianapolis, too.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I know it\\'s a young team, and I feel like me going to that situation is perfect.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I\\'m a guy that can step in and help contribute immediately.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 You and Devin went back to back.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Where were you in the arena and did you see him get drafted?  TREY LYLES:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Yeah, I was doing an interview but I turned around and I saw him, and then once I got done with another one, he was sitting down where I was.Ã‚Â\\xa0 So I said congratulations to him.Ã‚Â\\xa0 So it was cool for both of us.  Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 How did that strike you, four lottery picks from one team? TREY LYLES:Ã‚Â\\xa0 It just shows that our team was special.Ã‚Â\\xa0 It was unlike any other, and we\\'ve still got three other guys that are going to go tonight.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 A lot was made of the platoon system.Ã‚Â\\xa0 This spring Kentucky missed out on a few top targets.Ã‚Â\\xa0 People said maybe that was part of it.Ã‚Â\\xa0 But how much does tonight prove that that system worked? TREY LYLES:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Four lottery picks.Ã‚Â\\xa0 That doesn\\'t happen very often for one school, and we\\'ve still got three other guys, like I just said.Ã‚Â\\xa0 It just shows that if you go to a team and, you know, you have a platoon like we did, but you care about the team and not just yourself, you\\'re going to be successful no matter what.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 You mentioned to me yesterday that for obvious reasons you\\'re not going to be involved with the national team, but for the future looking forward, what can we expect from this team and how much can you contribute? TREY LYLES:Ã‚Â\\xa0 As far as the national team?   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Yes, sir.  TREY LYLES:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Looking forward to it.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Hopefully they can qualify for the Olympics next year and be able to be a part of that team.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Everybody knows Canada is on the uprise of basketball.Ã‚Â\\xa0 You\\'ve seen the last two years No. 1 picks with Anthony and Andrew.Ã‚Â\\xa0 So it\\'s definitely a team that\\'s going to be able to compete for medals in the near future.  Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 And what were your thoughts on Jamal Murray\\'s most recent commitment? TREY LYLES:Ã‚Â\\xa0 It\\'s great, another Canadian going to UK.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I\\'m sure he\\'s going to do great there.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Have you met Dante Exum?Ã‚Â\\xa0 And if not, have you watched him or just thoughts about him?Ã‚Â\\xa0 And if you have met him, what kind of conversations have you had? TREY LYLES:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I haven\\'t met him but I watched him play obviously in the Hoops Summit two years ago and then last season.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I know he\\'s a good guard and he\\'s on the uprise.Ã‚Â\\xa0 He\\'s a young guy but he\\'s learning a lot and he\\'s going to be a great player.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 The one thing about Salt Lake City is everything is a long plane flight.Ã‚Â\\xa0 What are your thoughts on that?Ã‚Â\\xa0 Did Gordon ever mention the wear and tear? TREY LYLES:Ã‚Â\\xa0 No, they haven\\'t, but anywhere you go it\\'s wear and tear.Ã‚Â\\xa0 You\\'re traveling all over the country every another night, so it\\'s no different there.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 What do you think are the best values you can bring to the team right away? TREY LYLES:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Being able to contribute offensively and defensively, just being a guy that goes out there and if they need a bucket, I\\'ll be able to be a guy that can go and get one, and just being a high‑character guy that\\'s going to fit in.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 With so many of your teammates going in the first round, what kind of competition do you guys have set up for the Rookie of the Year this year? TREY LYLES:Ã‚Â\\xa0 It\\'s between us all, but we haven\\'t talked about it, but it\\'s in each of our minds.Ã‚Â\\xa0 We want to be the best that we can be.Ã‚Â\\xa0 It\\'s going to be a challenge.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I\\'m sure we\\'re going to talk about it in the near future.

KEVON LOONEY:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I'm really excited to be able to switch defenses with them guys, be able to try to use my length to get to guys in the league, and be able to learn from guys like Iguodala and Draymond Green, great defenders; Klay Thompson and Steph Curry and learn from those guys.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I think I'll really learn from them up there.Ã‚Â\\xa0Ã‚Â\\xa0   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 What was going through your mind as the first round kept going on and you were still sitting there?

Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 What do you know about the Charlotte Hornets as a team?Ã‚Â\\xa0 And has it sunk in yet you have an endless supply of Brand Jordan?  FRANK KAMINSKY:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I'm becoming a sneakerhead recently, so that's obviously a great thing.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I know the team has got some good young guard play.Ã‚Â\\xa0 They're a team on the rise.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Obviously from my class, I remember Michael Kidd‑Gilchrist.Ã‚Â\\xa0 He's a good player.

FRANK KAMINSKY:Ã‚Â\\xa0 First of all, I couldn't fall asleep last night.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I was talking all day, I just wanted to figure out where I'm going.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I wish they would have woke me up in the morning and told me, so I didn't have to go through the whole day of wondering and listening to my agent and what he was saying.Ã‚Â\\xa0 So just when my name was finally called and I heard that I was going to be drafted, my heart started beating real fast.  It's just unreal.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Is it really is hard to put into words.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I'm kind of just spitballing here, but it's a dream come true, it really is.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Is there any player in the NBA that you look forward to playing against?  FRANK KAMINSKY:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Too many to count. Ã‚Â\\xa0I've had four years in college to watch the NBA closely and watch a lot of players.Ã‚Â\\xa0 People that jump off:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Kevin Durant, LeBron, Kobe, all the guys that I grew up watching.Ã‚Â\\xa0 It's just going to be amazing to get the chance to play against them, and I'm really looking forward to it.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I hear Michael Jordan likes to still be very competitive.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Was part of the workout going one‑on‑one with him?Ã‚Â\\xa0 I hear he still thinks he can go one‑on‑one with current players.  FRANK KAMINSKY:Ã‚Â\\xa0 No, I actually didn't get a chance to go down and visit with Charlotte.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Just part of the process.Ã‚Â\\xa0 You know how that goes.  Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Do you think he'll challenge you now that you're an employee? FRANK KAMINSKY:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Yeah, maybe.Ã‚Â\\xa0 We'll see when we get down there.  Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 You didn't work out for the Hornets.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Were you surprised that they took you? FRANK KAMINSKY:Ã‚Â\\xa0 No, we knew it was on the radar.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Like I said, it's just part of the process and scheduling and match‑ups and workouts.Ã‚Â\\xa0 It just didn't work out to where I went down to Charlotte and worked out, but they were definitely on the radar and definitely a team I was interested in.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Cody Zeller is obviously down in Charlotte.Ã‚Â\\xa0 You're two pretty similar players; both from the Big Ten.Ã‚Â\\xa0 How do you feel you can work together in the front court? FRANK KAMINSKY:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I had an opportunity to play against him for two years, so I know about him and I know where he started and where he is now.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Just looking forward to playing with him.Ã‚Â\\xa0 He's obviously a good player.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Like I said, I'm just so excited to get down there and find out what my role will be and try to make the most of it.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 We talked yesterday and I asked you about, I guess, the biggest criticism that people had about you.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Now that the draft process is over, if I can ask, what was the best advice that anybody gave you going into this process that made you feel at ease coming in here tonight? FRANK KAMINSKY:Ã‚Â\\xa0 From a lot of the different teams.Ã‚Â\\xa0 When you go and work out for teams, there's some teams that know they're not going to take you; they just have you in there for workouts.Ã‚Â\\xa0 You get to have good conversations with people and they're going to tell you the truth.Ã‚Â\\xa0 They told me not to listen, that I'm going to be fine in this league.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I'm going to have an opportunity to go out there and showcase what I can do, and that's really how it's been for me throughout my career at Wisconsin, I didn't listen to the critics or anything like that.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I just went out and did my thing.Ã‚Â\\xa0 It worked out really well for me.Ã‚Â\\xa0 So I'm looking forward to doing that at this level.  \"}, 'Stanley Johnson': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=110595', 'text': \"Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 How do you feel about going to a city like Detroit and what do you really know about the city?Ã‚Â\\xa0 And secondly, what do you expect in the NBA competitive‑wise in the first couple months of the season since it's a higher level?  STANLEY JOHNSON:Ã‚Â\\xa0 So you kind of lost me, but I'll try my best.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Going to the City of Detroit, I'll start with the basketball of it, because that's what's important here.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I'm used to watching the Pistons when they had Rip Hamilton and Ben Wallace and Tayshaun Prince, who's also still there now.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I'm used to the Bad Boys and some movies like that.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I remember the college I was at, we watched that about three or four times this year to bring that attitude to the court.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I know there's a couple guys on the team that brought that attitude to the court.Ã‚Â\\xa0 So now being able to follow that path with the players that were awesome like that, I'm excited to see that. The city is an awesome city.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I know the place is in Auburn Hills, close to a nice part of the city, and Downtown Detroit is what it is (laughing), so I'm also about that.  The second question, you lost me, so you'll have to repeat it.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 The second question was what do you expect to happen from a competitive standpoint now that you're in the NBA? STANLEY JOHNSON:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Yeah, I'm a competitor.Ã‚Â\\xa0 In my opinion, we all lace our shoes up the same way, from LeBron all the way down to the lowest guy in the league.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I think I'm going to be ready to compete versus everybody.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I've never been afraid of anybody, never been intimidated, and that's just how I was raised and how I was built.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 It's been a crazy journey for you.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Last summer you went head to head with everybody, LeBron, KD, even Tracy McGrady.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Do you feel you've sized yourself up for the NBA?Ã‚Â\\xa0 Do you feel like you're ready? STANLEY JOHNSON:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Yeah, I wouldn't have came out of college if I feel like I wasn't ready.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Playing Summer League versus LeBron and getting six Finals versus LeBron is going to be two different beasts.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I'm understanding of that.Ã‚Â\\xa0 But I feel like I'm ready to play.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Obviously there's going to be a lot of growth and development over the next couple months, getting used to the team and stuff like that.Ã‚Â\\xa0 But do I have the foundation to be ready to play right away?Ã‚Â\\xa0 I think so.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Traditionally one of the first purchases that basketball players make after signing their first contract is an automobile.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Will you guarantee your first car will be an American‑made car from one of the big three? STANLEY JOHNSON:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Yeah, my favorite car is a Challenger, Dodge Challenger.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Look out Dodge and Detroit.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I'm going to be a hell cat for them soon.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Do you have an endorsement deal with them yet? STANLEY JOHNSON:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Let's get one then.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I'm all for it.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 We met yesterday.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I asked you if it was too hot here.Ã‚Â\\xa0 You said it was not hot.Ã‚Â\\xa0 That's the easy part of this.Ã‚Â\\xa0 A little deeper here.Ã‚Â\\xa0 We talked about whether or not you're ready for the basketball stuff, the cars, the clothes, the girls; that's good, too.Ã‚Â\\xa0 You're going to a place like Detroit.Ã‚Â\\xa0 What are you ready to do with NBA Cares, reaching out in the community and showing that basketball doesn't end with the 94 and 50?Ã‚Â\\xa0 Where does it go? STANLEY JOHNSON:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I'm glad you asked that because I was raise the in the Salvation Army, I was in the Boys and Girls Club.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I have family that's been on skid row, if you've ever heard of that before.Ã‚Â\\xa0 That ties deep to me, going back and going back to the community and doing stuff for them.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I know in college and high school I was always giving back to people.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I'd go to gyms, I'd young kid with the same size shoes as me, I'd give him two pairs of shoes off my feet, give him the backpack off my back.  So to me giving back to the community is everything.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I think bringing up the community is going to bring up the positive energy in the city and bring up our team, as well.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I'm going to be active with NBA Cares and that, and to me obviously NBA Cares is not‑‑ I can do Stanley Johnson Cares and go do that.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I don't need pictures and I can do places by myself and be just as good as NBA Cares would be.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 You've got some good role models with Jalen Rose out there.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I think you've got some good conversations to talk to.  STANLEY JOHNSON:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Thank you, I appreciate it.  \"}, 'Rondae Hollis-Jefferson': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=110609', 'text': \"Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 With that outfit, did you know the Blazers were going to take you?Ã‚Â\\xa0 Second, what was going through your head waiting in that green room for your name to be called?  RONDAE HOLLIS‑JEFFERSON:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I would say for the first question, no, I didn't know that they would draft me. Ã‚Â\\xa0Red is my favorite color and I wanted to do something different.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I like different.  Second, it was tough.Ã‚Â\\xa0 It was tough, just being there waiting, and you're seeing a lot of your guys, peers going, and you're excited for them because you knew them for so long, but you also want to hear your name being called.Ã‚Â\\xa0 It was tough after a while, but then I was just waiting patiently.  Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 And also, you had Stanley here, you guys were teammates.Ã‚Â\\xa0 What was it like to share that experience with him tonight? RONDAE HOLLIS‑JEFFERSON:Ã‚Â\\xa0 It was really cool.Ã‚Â\\xa0 When his name was called, I stood up, gave him a standing ovation.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Just being proud, as a teammate, as a brother.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Happy for him.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Couldn't be happier.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 You had your own little fan club here tonight.Ã‚Â\\xa0 You brought 40 kids up from Chester.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Tell us about that and how that all came about. RONDAE HOLLIS‑JEFFERSON:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Well, I'm a big community guy and I wanted my people where I'm from, the tri‑state area, to experience it and see what it was like to be a part of that.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I talked to my family and my people, the close ones that I'm closest to about bringing some kids up to the Draft and let them get that experience and see how it is, and they were all for it.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I talked to my agency, and it just happened to work out like that.  We had the kids do essays about their life goals and their aspirations and what they want to be, and it turned out well.Ã‚Â\\xa0 100‑some kids filled out the essay; 40 of them won, and it was great.  Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Have you interacted with them and are you going to? RONDAE HOLLIS‑JEFFERSON:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Yes, I will after that.Ã‚Â\\xa0 They'll be waiting, long but patiently.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Portland Trail Blazers completely remade a lot of their roster, and they made the trade for Noah Vonleh and Gerald Henderson.Ã‚Â\\xa0 How do you feel like you fit in with that group? RONDAE HOLLIS‑JEFFERSON:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I'd say versatile.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Me being versatile, defend, transition, I feel like I fit in well, and then they're young guys.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I play with Noah and I feel like we all connect well on a trust level, on a teammate level, and we'll flow and it'll go smoothly.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 The Portland Trail Blazers are a team that the year before made it to the second round of the Playoffs, then lost in the first round this year.Ã‚Â\\xa0 How can a Rondae Hollis‑Jefferson bring the Portland Trail Blazers to where they want to be? RONDAE HOLLIS‑JEFFERSON:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I bring a lot of intensity, energy, athleticism, just the little things that teams need, that extra spark off the bench or if I do start, whatever the case may be, all teams need that extraness for their team to make them better, and I feel like I'm that dude that brings that.Ã‚Â\\xa0 If it's a swagger, if it's charisma, whatever, I feel like I bring all those intangibles to the team.  \"}, 'Jerian Grant': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=110610', 'text': \"Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 The Knicks are a team that has struggled for a long time.Ã‚Â\\xa0 They needed a point guard.Ã‚Â\\xa0 What kind of an impact are you going to make right away with the Knicks? JERIAN GRANT:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Play‑making.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I feel like I make the guys around me a lot better.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I feel like I get them open looks and make the guys around me better, so we'll be ready to compete right away.  Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Usually a lot of players come to the NBA after playing one or two years in college.Ã‚Â\\xa0 How has playing all four years in college really helped you prepare for the NBA? JERIAN GRANT:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Just being a more mature player, physically, mentally, just all the way around.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I think I'm a more mature player and ready to handle things and ready to come and contribute right away.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Mike Brey was raving about what a good fit you are for this team.Ã‚Â\\xa0 How do you see yourself fitting with this team and playing in the triangle? JERIAN GRANT:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Yeah, high basketball IQ.Ã‚Â\\xa0 The triangle has high‑basketball‑IQ players, and I think I'm one of those.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I pick up on the offense really quickly and help the guys around me.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 You're so close to your brother now.Ã‚Â\\xa0 How does it feel to kind of play so close to him in the same division here?Ã‚Â\\xa0 And then second, you're part of two Knicks' first‑round picks.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Did you get a chance to talk to Porzingis at all? JERIAN GRANT:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Yeah, being close to my brother, close to family is just‑‑ when you need to turn to those guys, they are right there with you, they're a drive away, so that's special.  Yeah, it's funny, I actually talked to him at the hotel.Ã‚Â\\xa0 He was like, he'd be excited if he went to the Knicks.Ã‚Â\\xa0 That's actually what he told me.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I kind of smiled and laughed and shook my head, not realizing that I'd be his teammate a few hours later.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 When you found out it was the Knicks, what were your emotions about that?  JERIAN GRANT:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Yeah, I was extremely excited just to be here, just to have an opportunity to come in and make the team better and be able to contribute right away.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I think I'm excited for that.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Your father and his brother played in the NBA.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Now you're going to be playing in the NBA with your brother.Ã‚Â\\xa0 What does that say about the legacy of the Grants in the NBA? JERIAN GRANT:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I feel like it says that we work hard.Ã‚Â\\xa0 We work extremely hard.Ã‚Â\\xa0 We're a family that likes to come in and contribute to a team right away, and my dad and my uncle did it, and my brother did it last year as a rookie.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I'm looking forward to contributing to this team.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I know that some of the coach and some of the other guys stuck around and watched your workout.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Did you feel when the Knicks made the pick at 4, there was talk about them trading back, that becoming a Knick was a reality, or was it a real surprise for you? JERIAN GRANT:Ã‚Â\\xa0 It was a little bit of a surprise.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I felt like any team could take me.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I didn't think because they didn't have another pick.Ã‚Â\\xa0 But I'm excited to be here and excited to come in and help this team.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 What was the best advice that you've gotten from your brother, uncle or father for being in the NBA?  JERIAN GRANT:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Bring it.Ã‚Â\\xa0 You're going to have to bring it and continue to work hard.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Just because you're in the NBA doesn't mean you made it yet.Ã‚Â\\xa0 They said it's easier to get there than it is to stay.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I know they tell me I'm going to have to keep working extremely hard.  Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 You're from the D.C. area.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Were you excited to go maybe possibly to the Wizards? JERIAN GRANT:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Yeah, I was just excited to be in the NBA.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Of course, being home would be really exciting, but I think this opportunity here with the Knicks is a blessing.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 What has your Uncle Horace told you about playing for Phil Jackson?Ã‚Â\\xa0 Has he told you any stories from back in the day?Ã‚Â\\xa0 And what do you know about dunking on the Madison Square Garden stage? JERIAN GRANT:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I'm sure I'll have some conversations about Phil Jackson, but I haven't talked to him about that yet much.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I'm excited to play in the Garden.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I've played there a few times, had some wins, had some great moments, but it'll be nothing like putting on a Knicks jersey and playing in there.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 You mentioned earlier about having a legacy of family members that played in the NBA.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Was there any sibling rivalry on the court in the backyards growing up and playing against your brother? JERIAN GRANT:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Of course.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I have an older brother that's playing overseas, younger brother with Philly, and my youngest.Ã‚Â\\xa0 We all were competing back then.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I think that's what's made us so competitive and made us work so hard, because we wanted to be better than the other one.  Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I saw Coach Brey here to support you.Ã‚Â\\xa0 What does it mean to you to have him here for this moment? JERIAN GRANT:Ã‚Â\\xa0 It's huge.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I owe him a huge part of my success.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Being at Notre Dame for four years, he was with me every step of the way and recruiting me there, telling me that we were going to do something special, and recruiting me back when I left.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I owe him a huge part of my success.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 We talked about the opportunity to play with Porzingis and play under Phil Jackson and Coach Derek Fisher but talk about the opportunity to play with Carmelo Anthony? JERIAN GRANT:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Yeah, he makes the game extremely easy on offense.Ã‚Â\\xa0 When you need a basket you can give it to him.Ã‚Â\\xa0 But his play‑making skills are a skill that people don't really know he has.Ã‚Â\\xa0 The defense has to have all eyes on him, so spacing the floor and being able to knock down shots, playing with him and Kris, I think two great offensive players I think will open things up for me.  \"}, 'Sam Dekker': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=110605', 'text': 'Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I know yesterday talking to you, you felt you could have gone in any range, from the lottery maybe all the way to the early 20s.Ã‚Â\\xa0 How did you feel like just sitting there kind of as the picks were going by and you kind of fell out of the lottery?Ã‚Â\\xa0 How did that feel?  SAM DEKKER:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Well, I mean, I\\'m not going to say it felt good because you feel like you deserve to be there.Ã‚Â\\xa0 The body of work I did, the way I performed in the workouts, I feel like I definitely deserved to be a high pick.Ã‚Â\\xa0 But like I said, like my dad always says before I do everything, he says, trust in God\\'s plan and that it\\'s all going to work out for us in the end.  I don\\'t know if you missed (inaudible), but me getting placed and picked by Houston is the biggest blessing to me and it\\'s something that was the best‑case scenario.Ã‚Â\\xa0 It\\'s a very good fit like I said, and a great team.  Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 It couldn\\'t have worked out really better for you.Ã‚Â\\xa0 You won a lot of games at Wisconsin.Ã‚Â\\xa0 How does it feel to go to a team that made actually a pretty deep run in the playoffs?  SAM DEKKER:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Yeah, that\\'s exactly what you said, going to a team with a good foundation, a solid roster, front office, all the places are there for a great team.Ã‚Â\\xa0 They had teams that went wire to wire with the Warriors, the champions this past year, and you could see the challenge there and the will to win.Ã‚Â\\xa0 When you have that winning culture around, that\\'s what you want to be a part of.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I\\'ve always been part of winning as well.  So hopefully I can come in, be a solid teammate and be a guy that can be a face of winning and help out in that regard.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 You played with a big man in Frank that could draw a lot of attention. Ã‚Â\\xa0Now you get Dwight Howard and James.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Are you prepared for all the daylight you\\'re going to see on the perimeter? SAM DEKKER:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Yeah, that\\'ll be the most daylight I\\'ve ever gotten.Ã‚Â\\xa0 When you said Dwight, it got me excited, I\\'m watching my team (looking at the Rockets on a monitor).Ã‚Â\\xa0 It got me excited because if I get in the paint, I can just throw it up in the air and Dwight will go get it, or if I pass it to James, I\\'ll get an assist automatically.  You\\'re excited to play with the greats.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Those are two guys, especially Dwight being more veteran, guys you watched growing up and you want to be in their shoes, and I call them teammates hopefully for a long time.Ã‚Â\\xa0 It\\'s pretty surreal, but once I get down there, I\\'m sure it\\'ll sink in a little more.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 You were selected by the Houston Rockets, a team that made a deep playoff run to the Western Conference Finals.Ã‚Â\\xa0 How can a Sam Dekker build on that? SAM DEKKER:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Well, I think I\\'m a piece that can come in and be ready to play.Ã‚Â\\xa0 You know, playing three years at Wisconsin, being young for my class but having those three strong years and playing in a bunch of different venues, playing in two Final Fours, that stuff doesn\\'t faze me.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I\\'ve played at the best competition at my level, which was college, and now going up into the NBA, I think I can make that step a little smoother than most.  So I think I\\'ll be able to add to any organization, but Houston made a good pick, and I\\'m excited to just be a part of that culture and go out there.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I think I can step in and be a key contributor right away.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Have you gotten a chance to talk to Frank yet?Ã‚Â\\xa0 What did you guys say to each other and what do you feel about his situation? SAM DEKKER:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Yeah, I didn\\'t get a chance to talk to him since we were back here, but I was happy his table was right next to mine so I could give him a hug and tell him how proud I was of him.Ã‚Â\\xa0 He\\'s one of those guys he\\'s seen what I\\'ve gone through and we know each other\\'s story, we know each other\\'s work ethic and everything.Ã‚Â\\xa0 And to share this night with a guy like him says a lot about us but says a lot about Wisconsin basketball and the coaching staff there and the things they\\'re doing over there, as well. This is a winning night for not only my family but Wisconsin basketball family, Badger Nation, and just proud of Frank and how far he\\'s come, and really great to have him as a friend.  Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Can you take me through the conversation going on at your table as the picks were going by, right up until I imagine your agent tells you you\\'re going to be picked before you hear the Commissioner say your name.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Is that accurate? SAM DEKKER:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Yeah, it was weird because we thought there was literally like six or seven picks before that where I could have landed.Ã‚Â\\xa0 We\\'re like, okay, this could be us.Ã‚Â\\xa0 It\\'s either you or this guy.Ã‚Â\\xa0 It\\'s either you or this guy, and it was always not me.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I\\'m like, am I going to get picked tonight?Ã‚Â\\xa0 What\\'s going on?Ã‚Â\\xa0 I wasn\\'t fretting because I knew I was going to end up somewhere, somewhere good, and look at the fit that I landed in.  No, it was weird because my agent was like, I don\\'t know if Houston is in play here, and then I looked up and it was like a minute left on that clock, and he\\'s like, this might be us.Ã‚Â\\xa0 And my brother goes, \"You\\'re going to be a Rocket.\"Ã‚Â\\xa0 I go, \"Really?\"Ã‚Â\\xa0 He\\'s like, \"Yeah, you\\'re going to be a Rocket.\"Ã‚Â\\xa0 That\\'s when it kind of hit me.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Then Adam Silver walked out and he looked at my table and I knew it was real.Ã‚Â\\xa0 That\\'s a moment I\\'ll always remember, and I\\'m forever grateful for that.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 What comes next now that you\\'ve achieved this lifelong goal?Ã‚Â\\xa0 What\\'s next?  SAM DEKKER:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Get back in the gym and start working as an official member of the Houston Rockets and get better.Ã‚Â\\xa0 That\\'s what I always say, basketball is the greatest sport because you can put, good or bad, the last day behind you and wake up in the morning and get better.Ã‚Â\\xa0 That\\'s something I want to do, can\\'t wait to get down there and work with the coaching staff, the training staff and my new teammates and show them what I can do for the organization and hopefully make a long career there.  Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 In terms of the style you want to play, I\\'m guessing there couldn\\'t have been a better fit than Houston in the league.  SAM DEKKER:Ã‚Â\\xa0 You\\'re completely right.Ã‚Â\\xa0 You\\'ve been watching me since I was in high school, and you\\'ve seen I can get up and move and shoot from the outside and attack from the perimeter.Ã‚Â\\xa0 That\\'s something I love to do.Ã‚Â\\xa0 If you watch Houston, that\\'s something they love to do.Ã‚Â\\xa0 They\\'re not afraid of taking shots.Ã‚Â\\xa0 They\\'re not afraid of making quick decisions.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Just playing on feel but playing under control and playing smart, and Coach McHale has them doing that very well.  So that\\'s something I can do and I\\'m comfortable with, and yeah, I think I\\'ll be able to mesh in very well with that way of play.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 You\\'ve been kind of a Wisconsin guy your whole life.Ã‚Â\\xa0 What is it going to be like to be in Houston with no winter? SAM DEKKER:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Yeah, I literally thought of that right away.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I was like, I can throw away some of those big coats that I\\'ve got.  It\\'s pretty cool, I\\'ve never lived outside of Wisconsin, so it\\'s going to be fun to get down to a warmer climate, see what January is like in Texas.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Maybe I\\'ll have to ask J.J. how he handled the transition.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 How do you think that your game translates right now, and how do you think it fits next to James Harden? SAM DEKKER:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I think my game translates well because I\\'m pretty versatile.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I can play 2 through 4 on both ends of the court, can space the floor, knock down a shot and drive, and make those quick decisions.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Whenever you have an all‑pro, MVP‑caliber player like James Harden next to you, it makes the game that much easier and opens it up for you.  No team wins with just one guy.Ã‚Â\\xa0 You\\'ve got to have more than one guy.Ã‚Â\\xa0 So James being that guy, they look for pieces to build around that, and I think Houston has done a great job of putting their team and having that foundation in a position to win games, and that\\'s what they\\'re doing and that\\'s what we\\'re going to continue to do.

RAKEEM CHRISTMAS:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I take pride in playing defense.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Being a part of that type of team is great.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I just want to go out there, play defense, get rebounds, block shots, and that's my game.  Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Typically I realize a lot of players in the Draft over the last few years come to the NBA after one or two years in college.Ã‚Â\\xa0 How has playing about three, four years in college prepared you for the NBA? RAKEEM CHRISTMAS:Ã‚Â\\xa0 They've prepared me a lot, I learned a lot from Coach Boeheim.Ã‚Â\\xa0 There's a lot of experience there.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Being at Syracuse it's a great program, a winning program and being around Coach Boeheim taught me a lot and prepared me for this whole moment right here.  Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I'm not sure if you heard the report about possibly going to Cleveland, but if you do what's it going to be like playing with LeBron James? RAKEEM CHRISTMAS:Ã‚Â\\xa0 It's going to be a great experience.Ã‚Â\\xa0 That's someone I look up to.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I worked out for them, so I wouldn't know if that's true or not.Ã‚Â\\xa0 That would be a great experience for me, and they're a great team, and I'd just be happy to be a part of that.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 After your junior year, was there even a possibility in your mind being in the NBA?Ã‚Â\\xa0 And did you imagine this kind of senior season you had and getting here? RAKEEM CHRISTMAS:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Yeah, I just had to wait my turn.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I had people ahead of me, C.J. Fair, Jerami Grant, Tyler Ennis.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I didn't have to do that much my junior year.Ã‚Â\\xa0 In my senior Coach Boeheim pulled me aside and told me it was going to be my team this year and to step it up, and that's what I did this year.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 After your name was announced, what was your first thought? RAKEEM CHRISTMAS:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Thank God.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I was just sitting there the whole time.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I just wanted it to be over, and it happened, and I'm just happy this whole experience is over and I'm happy in the situation I'm in right now.  \"}, 'Willie Cauley-Stein': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=110594', 'text': \"Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Can you reflect on this past year with Kentucky and the fact that tonight is probably going to be a historical night for the program, so many guys getting drafted could break a record.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Have you talked about that with the other guys that could be picked tonight in recent weeks or months about what that means for Kentucky basketball as a whole and for you to be a part of it? WILLIE CAULEY‑STEIN:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Obviously it's just good for the program.Ã‚Â\\xa0 It shows that a bunch of young kids can come together and still win, and at the end of the day still get drafted.Ã‚Â\\xa0 There's a lot of scrutiny on Coach Cal can't take young guys and turn them into a team and make them win and still be for each other and get drafted and play in their dreams.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 You mentioned DeMarcus Cousins.Ã‚Â\\xa0 How do you feel like you fit with DeMarcus, and how can you be on the floor together? WILLIE CAULEY‑STEIN:Ã‚Â\\xa0 We're both really versatile.Ã‚Â\\xa0 He's a banger, but he also got finesse.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I complement him on defense and on the offensive side.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I'm able to space out the court and use my speed and quickness against people.  I think we're going to have a good duo there.  Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Obviously Kings needed a rim defender and you're a guy that can bring defense, can guard multiple positions.Ã‚Â\\xa0 What do you feel you bring to Sacramento on the offensive side of the floor? WILLIE CAULEY‑STEIN:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I mean, anything that they need me to bring.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I think I'm versatile enough to do just about anything on the offensive side.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Just now I get a chance to perfect my craft on it.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 There's been a lot of controversy this week surrounding the Kings and possibly trading DeMarcus Cousins and George Karl's controversy.Ã‚Â\\xa0 What do you think about that and possibly going to a franchise that may be not the most stable at this time?  WILLIE CAULEY‑STEIN:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I mean, it doesn't even really matter how stable they are or not.Ã‚Â\\xa0 You know, they're going to end up coming together and putting pieces together to make a good team that can compete.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Whether DeMarcus stays or he goes, they're still going to do what they do and have a team that's going to play to win.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 There was so much talk leading up to this thing about, is the ankle an issue, is the offense an issue, does Willie love the game, is he going to slide in this draft.Ã‚Â\\xa0 There was some talk about if you got past the Kings.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Were you nervous?Ã‚Â\\xa0 How nervous?Ã‚Â\\xa0 And what were your thoughts before they picked you? WILLIE CAULEY‑STEIN:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I wasn't nervous at all.Ã‚Â\\xa0 You know, I'm a strong believer in whatever happens, happens.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I was just riding the wave.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Whenever I got picked up, that's the place I was supposed to be at.Ã‚Â\\xa0 It's the Kings, so that's where I'm supposed to be at, and I'm just blessed to have the opportunity to go there and play.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 You had talked a little bit in the lead‑up to the Draft about thinking that your offensive game would be something that would surprise some people, that you were a little better on that end that some people thought.Ã‚Â\\xa0 What do you think you can do at a higher level that people are doubting at this point? WILLIE CAULEY‑STEIN:Ã‚Â\\xa0 You know, shoot the ball.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I mean, obviously I can score around the rim, so that's not a big question mark.Ã‚Â\\xa0 But shooting the ball, get to the free‑throw line, make free throws, use my speed and quickness and dribble past bigger dudes that are just going to have to guard me.Ã‚Â\\xa0 It just depends on what I do now and how I take the next step in my learning curve.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Kings had to have been looking up at the Lakers and Golden State and the Clippers for a couple years now.Ã‚Â\\xa0 What's your message for the fan base, unless a trade happens or anything like that?  WILLIE CAULEY‑STEIN:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I'm super loyal, and the fact that they got a lot of cool things happening in the city with the new arena and they're redoing that downtown area, so it's going to be something really nice for the fans.Ã‚Â\\xa0 You know, hopefully we can turn it around as a squad and bring something passionate and fun to the city.Ã‚Â\\xa0 You know, we can be looked up as the Clippers and the Lakers and the Warriors.  I'm just going to bring a lot of fun and energy to the city.Ã‚Â\\xa0 That's really all I've got to say.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Off and on DeMarcus has kind of talked about how he wants out, he wants out of the Sacramento, away from the Kings.Ã‚Â\\xa0 How does that play on your mind and how well do you know the City of Sacramento?  WILLIE CAULEY‑STEIN:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I've been there once.Ã‚Â\\xa0 It's a nice city.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I actually like it a lot.Ã‚Â\\xa0 A lot of people say, it's a bad city to go to, you don't want to be there.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I didn't see that.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I think it fits right into my personality.Ã‚Â\\xa0 It's super chill, modern style city.  And I don't really know DeMarcus's situation, so I can't really speak on that.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I believe the mayor of Sacramento is a former NBA player, Kevin Johnson.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Actually you have three years of college, and having more credits to graduate, what's your major over at Kentucky? WILLIE CAULEY‑STEIN:Ã‚Â\\xa0 My major is communications.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I only have a semester left, so I'm really close to graduating.Ã‚Â\\xa0 That's something I'll finish in the next year or so.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I'm going to be taking courses throughout the year, maybe here and there, just something to just keep on building on, and over time just chisel away.  Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I know you got the custom logo made for yourself a while back.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Is this new that you got it put on the gold necklace tonight? WILLIE CAULEY‑STEIN:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Oh, yeah.  Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Tell us about that.  WILLIE CAULEY‑STEIN:Ã‚Â\\xa0 A little something you spoil yourself with.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I got a couple of them made.Ã‚Â\\xa0 It's just good fun, branding.Ã‚Â\\xa0 It's a little logo that me and my boys put together, so it's something that we're pushing, and hopefully it takes off.  \"}, 'Devin Booker': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=110600', 'text': 'Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 If we had told you back in October when you were looking around that locker room that really seven of the guys in there would have a chance of getting picked, what would you have said?Ã‚Â\\xa0 And can you speak to the culture that your coaches built?Ã‚Â\\xa0Ã‚Â\\xa0  DEVIN BOOKER:Ã‚Â\\xa0 If you told me seven of us would have been in this situation, I would have believed it but I don\\'t think I would have been here.Ã‚Â\\xa0 The great group of talent that we had, I just felt like I was going to be there in a few years and I was going to learn from the older people and just come in and get better every year.Ã‚Â\\xa0 But the success of the team helped me out a lot, and you know, it\\'s one of the greatest teams‑‑ well, the greatest team I\\'ve ever been on, and hopefully we can do the same in Phoenix.  Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 How fierce will the competition be for Rookie of the Year among the four of you guys?  DEVIN BOOKER:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Well, it\\'s not out of just us four; there\\'s a lot more.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I\\'m pretty sure it\\'ll be fierce.Ã‚Â\\xa0 We\\'re all competitive guys, and that\\'s how our class has been, ever since we\\'ve been in the seventh and eighth grade we\\'ve always competed.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I\\'m proud of all of them, but we all have an understanding that on the next level we\\'re all competing.  Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 What was that moment like, Trey goes, you go right after, he said you guys found each other after some interviews.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Just to share that back‑to‑back with a guy you spent so much time with? DEVIN BOOKER:Ã‚Â\\xa0 It\\'s unbelievable.Ã‚Â\\xa0 It\\'s like the Karl situation; I was pulling for him to go No.1.Ã‚Â\\xa0 It\\'s because we\\'re teammates, we\\'re brothers, and we developed that brotherhood at Kentucky.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I\\'m just so proud of those guys, and there\\'s still some more that have to come off the board and they\\'re going to have bright futures, also.  Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 What does four lottery picks say to you? DEVIN BOOKER:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Talented team, and Cal is great.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 You talked about your brothers that are drafted, now you\\'re going where Archie Goodwin, Eric Bledsoe, some other UK guys.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Talk about that roster, where you\\'re going to fit into that and what do you bring to the Phoenix Suns.  DEVIN BOOKER:Ã‚Â\\xa0 That roster is really talented with three UK guys there.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I feel I can bring shooting.Ã‚Â\\xa0 That\\'s my elite talent that I feel translates to the next level right away.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I still feel like I have a lot to show that I still can show.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Who designed that stylish blue? Ã‚Â\\xa0Tell me more about it.  DEVIN BOOKER:Ã‚Â\\xa0 A lot went into it.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I\\'m kind of a fashion guy, but obviously it\\'s Big Blue Nation.Ã‚Â\\xa0 This is Kentucky right here.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I owed it to them after this great season that they gave to us.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I gave them a little tribute with my suit color.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Me and my dad talked about it a lot.Ã‚Â\\xa0 A lot went into it, but I like how it looks.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I see your middle name is Armani.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I assume that that puts some pressure on being sartorially sharp.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Is it an Armani suit per se?  DEVIN BOOKER:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I\\'ve actually met Giorgio before.Ã‚Â\\xa0 My dad played for Armani Jeans overseas, so when I went and visited him, I met him.Ã‚Â\\xa0 So I guess we\\'ll see, but yeah, I\\'m definitely a fashion guy.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 How familiar are you with the head coach of the Phoenix Suns Jeff Hornacek? DEVIN BOOKER:Ã‚Â\\xa0 Hornacek, he actually did the workout when we went there.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I didn\\'t know much about him then but we kind of developed a relationship there.Ã‚Â\\xa0 We had a great vibe with him.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I was talking with him Eric, and Eric said, \"We need a shooter here:Ã‚Â\\xa0 So I guess they made that come true.   Q.Ã‚Â\\xa0 Phoenix only missed the playoffs by a handful of games.Ã‚Â\\xa0 How do you feel about being in the Western Conference? DEVIN BOOKER:Ã‚Â\\xa0 I know it\\'s talented and I know it\\'s a deep conference and I know it\\'s hard.Ã‚Â\\xa0 That\\'s why I went to Kentucky.Ã‚Â\\xa0 We wanted everything hard and that\\'s just how we do it.Ã‚Â\\xa0 We wouldn\\'t want it any other way.Ã‚Â\\xa0 I know there\\'s a lot of talented teams in the West, so I\\'m looking forward to playing against those teams.

And what do you feel is going to be -- how do you feel that such a prestigious organization drafted you and thinks so highly of you? IVICA ZUBAC: From the day I started playing basketball, the Lakers were my favorite team, and Kobe was my favorite player.  I cannot believe this is happening.  I'm so happy right now. Q. Does it hurt a little bit knowing you won't be able to team with Kobe since he's retired? IVICA ZUBAC: Yeah, before this draft I was thinking like I'm coming to the league and Kobe is going out.  I won't be able to play against him or with him.

Danny Ainge and I think his son Austin came and watched you.  What did you talk about and what did he like and what did he not like? ANTE ZIZIC: You know, a few times -- he was in Zagreb once and watched my game and probably he liked me because I'm always 100 percent.  I run the floor very well.  I talked a little bit with him but nothing special.  I was not in a workout in Boston.  I was in with other clubs, but I'm thankful because they got me. Q. Did the Celtics talk to you at all about potentially staying overseas for a year or two and keep developing? ANTE ZIZIC: Not yet.  Not yet. Q. Is that something you would be open to or do you really want to come over here now and play? ANTE ZIZIC: Now I'm going to see what's going to happen because I need a day to think about, to talk with the guys from club and everything. Q. What does it say about Croatian basketball that you and Bender both got drafted in this first round? ANTE ZIZIC: You know, Croatia is part of Europe where you got always a lot of young guys, talented guys, and we like basketball.  We practice a lot.  Dragan and I grew up together and from same club.  We played many years, and he's my best friend in basketball.  I am thankful because both of us are selected at a very good spot on the board. Q. How would you compare yourself to him? ANTE ZIZIC: For draft? Q. To Dragan in terms of your skills. ANTE ZIZIC: Like player?  We are different position.  I play center, he was a power forward.

I talked to the coach a little bit, talked to the GM.  I knew there was interest, but I don't believe that I'm going to be the 16th pick. Q. Had the Celtics talked to you about their plans, if they want you to stay overseas for a little while? GUERSCHON YABUSELE: Not really.

What were your emotions like?  I saw you had all your family and friends there to hear your name called, something I\\'m sure you\\'ve thought about for a long, long time. ISAIAH WHITEHEAD: It was a great accomplishment even to be called into the draft.  My family and my friends stuck with me through everything, so I\\'ve got to give everything to them and the way they stuck with me throughout the whole process. Q. There are reports it\\'s the Nets who actually are taking you.  To be able to play in your home borough, what\\'s that like? ISAIAH WHITEHEAD: I mean, that\\'s everything.  Just to be able to wear that Brooklyn uniform across my chest, it would be an amazing accomplishment, and I can\\'t wait for it. Q. Talk about having to wait so long to be picked. ISAIAH WHITEHEAD: I mean, everyone has their journey.  Everyone has their path, so I guess this is mine. Q. How do you think you\\'ll handle the pressure of now playing at home? ISAIAH WHITEHEAD: I mean, there\\'s no pressure.  I mean, I played here in high school, I\\'ve played across the bridge in Seton Hall, so it\\'s really not far away.  It\\'s just about being about your business and taking care of what you\\'ve got to take care of. Q. Did you hear much from the Nets today?  Did you know they were going to make this trade and get you?  And also did the Knicks talk to you about trying to get a draft pick to get you? ISAIAH WHITEHEAD: Actually the only time I talked to those two teams was when I worked out with them.  The Nets really liked my game.  They liked me since I was in school, so it\\'s not a surprise that they picked me, but it\\'s definitely a blessing. Q. Do you see a chance to get a lot of playing time there since they kind of traded a lot of their players away? ISAIAH WHITEHEAD: I think playing time, you\\'ve got to earn it.  You\\'ve got to go into training camp and preseason and do what you\\'ve got to do to earn playing time.  I\\'m not giving anything -- I definitely know I go to the next level and earn what I get, so I\\'m looking forward to it. Q. Do you feel an added sense of pressure now that you\\'re going to be playing in Brooklyn to put on for your city? ISAIAH WHITEHEAD: Definitely not.  People probably look at it that way, but it\\'s just basketball, and I\\'m good at it.  I\\'m going to just try to take it by storm and really just play well for Brooklyn. Q. Do you think this is something that\\'s coming full circle for you? ISAIAH WHITEHEAD: I mean, definitely, man.  I mean, it\\'s a dream come true.  Me and my friends and my family are really, really happy at this moment and we\\'re going to try to just enjoy the night. Q. You\\'re going to be playing with Brooklyn.  You\\'re going to be playing with a young team, a team that is kind of in a rebuilding phase at this point in time.  What do you feel would be the ideal role for you and what kind of success could you have in your first year with the Nets? ISAIAH WHITEHEAD: Basically whatever they need me to do.  If they need me to be on the bench cheering, then that\\'s what I\\'ve got to do.  If they need me to play and produce, that\\'s what I\\'ve got to do.  It\\'s a job now, so you\\'ve got to go to work every day and take care of business. Q. How much do you feel this will motivate you not getting selected in the first round? ISAIAH WHITEHEAD: It\\'s definitely motivation.  I mean, I always dreamed about being a first-round pick.  It didn\\'t happen, so you\\'ve got to move on and just keep working and try to prove everyone wrong. Q. Did you have a chance to talk to Coach Willard, any of the Seton Hall players before today or even during today leading up to the draft? ISAIAH WHITEHEAD: Those guys wrote me a text.  They called me after the first round saying, \"Keep your head up,\" and I\\'m like, \"Hey, if I get picked, I\\'m blessed.\"  There\\'s no rush to get picked.  Wherever you get picked you\\'ve got to go there and take care of what you\\'ve got to take care of. Q. The fact that you got picked in the second round, does that make you reevaluate your decision or does it not matter, you\\'re in the league now? ISAIAH WHITEHEAD: Once you make a decision like that, there\\'s no looking back.  You can\\'t go back and say I should have did this, I should have did that.  It\\'s done.  There\\'s no reason to try to reflect on it and try to think about anything else because I can\\'t take it back even if I wanted to. Q. How well do you know and McCullough each other?  You\\'re going to be teammates, two city guys. ISAIAH WHITEHEAD: I know Chris McCullough very well, since junior high school playing against him, playing with him.  He\\'s a great player, and he\\'s a good friend of mine. Q. What\\'s that like for two city guys playing for the hometown team? ISAIAH WHITEHEAD: I mean, it\\'s basically two city guys just trying to get to somewhere in life, just trying to grow and play for NBA teams.  It will be a blessing to have his friends and his family there and my friends and family there and to watch us play. Q. After a great season at Seton Hall including making the NCAA Tournament, was it a hard decision to enter the NBA Draft? ISAIAH WHITEHEAD: Definitely.  I mean, my teammates were like my brothers, so leaving those guys was definitely tough, but they understood.  They understood I wanted to chase my dream and play in the NBA.  So when I told them, they was all for it. Q. How do you feel about being the first Brooklyn-born player to play for Brooklyn? ISAIAH WHITEHEAD: It\\'s a blessing, man.  It\\'s definitely in the books.  It\\'s a dream come true.  Since Brooklyn got here, I always wanted to play for them, so it\\'s definitely a dream come true. Q. What part of your game do you still have to work on, if anything? ISAIAH WHITEHEAD: Probably ball handling, sharpen that up a little bit.  I definitely can shoot better.  Just decision making, and after that, I feel like I\\'ll be a good player.'}, 'Denzel Valentine': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=120748', 'text': \"Q. Being an older player in this draft, some would said you have less potential or room to grow compared to 19, 20-year olds.  Is there any validity to those statements? DENZEL VALENTINE: I mean, you can never win I feel like in my place, being a senior.  I just got better every year, and why is that going to stop now?  You know, I feel like when I get to the next level I'm just going to keep on getting better.  You just keep on getting better, those guys that have more potential than me, they're supposed to keep getting better, so I will keep getting better. Q. What are some other advantages that you have as an older player? DENZEL VALENTINE: I mean, I was able to grow as a person off the court and on the court.  I developed skills.  My shooting percentage got better.  I got more comfortable playing ball screens, learning the game.  Just everything that college brings to you as far as being NBA ready, and when you're NBA ready, you can come in and contribute right away. Q. What's something that Coach Izzo taught you that will stick with you and help you at this level? DENZEL VALENTINE: Definitely just being passionate and having that goal every single day you come to practice or every single day you wake up just having one goal in mind and letting nothing get in the way of it, and that's how I'm going to be and that's how I was raised.  So that's how I'm going to be for the rest of my life. Q. I know you were sitting there with your arm around your mom.  Sum up what you were feeling with your brother there, your dad -- DENZEL VALENTINE: It was like -- at the start of the draft, let's face it, I knew I wasn't going to go No. 1, and then by like 7, 8, 9, I was like, all right, now it's draft time for me.  11, 12, you know, I'm like, oh, keeps going five minutes, five minutes.  And then after 13 I get really nervous, dang, when am I going to get my name called?  It's been an hour, so I got really nervous.  Once they said my name, it just came out.  I didn't even plan what to shout out.  It just came out.  I'm just very happy to be part of the Bulls. Q. There were a lot of things being said in and around the draft, knees, concerns, how durable you could be.  You tried to answer a lot of that.  Do you feel like that contributed to you not going as high as you thought you were going to go? DENZEL VALENTINE: I really didn't know how high I was going to go.  I was somewhere in the first-round range.  I didn't know exactly where I was going to go.  But I definitely think my knee was definitely false because I've been healthy my whole career pretty much, and I'm healthy right now.  I may have a little bit of wear and tear just like everybody else will, so I'm just excited to get going, and happy to be with the Bulls.\"}, 'Ben Simmons': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=120738', 'text': 'Q. Ben, after all the buildup, what does it finally feel like once you heard your name? BEN SIMMONS: It honestly feels like all this pressure just has hopped off me.  Now I can relax, but now I know where I\\'m going to be.  More importantly, I know where I\\'m headed and know I can really start working on what I need to work on for the team. Q. Your message to everyone back at home who\\'s supported you and helped you get to this position? BEN SIMMONS: I love everyone who\\'s been supporting me back home in Australia.  I\\'ll be back soon, so you guys will know when I\\'ll be back, and looking forward to meeting everyone. Q. I read that you wanted to be in the NBA since you were seven years old and you accomplished that goal in 12 years.  How does that feel?  And do you have any advice for kids that want to accomplish their goal? BEN SIMMONS: It feels amazing, honestly.  I can\\'t even -- my legs were shaking when I was on stage.  Anything you want to do, you can do, honestly.  I\\'ve been wanting to do that since I was five, six, seven, and I\\'ve finally accomplished that. Q. Yesterday in Melbourne, Dante Exum said that he can\\'t wait to match up on you when you start playing in the league.  Who\\'s the Australian you most want to match up on? BEN SIMMONS: Dante.  I\\'m definitely going at him when we play. Q. Why is that? BEN SIMMONS: We\\'ve had rivalries since we were like seven years old.  It\\'s kind of weird seeing that relationship change from playing in the backyard to now we\\'re going to be playing in the NBA. Q. You posted on Instagram the other day, \"Trust the process.\"  What inspired you to do that? BEN SIMMONS: Sixers.  I\\'m a part of the family now, so you\\'ve got to trust it.  You\\'ve got to go with it and you\\'ve got to work hard. Q. Did you have any sort of understanding of where that phrase came from or what it means? BEN SIMMONS: A little bit.  A little bit.  I know it\\'s been said around a lot of the Sixers\\' community, so I\\'m a little bit aware of it. Q. Lots of young guys in your position have had knock-back setbacks along the way.  Did you have any of those, and what would you say to those people now who might have told you, you may not make this? BEN SIMMONS: Nothing, honestly.  They\\'ve seen me make it, so I mean, there\\'s a lot of work that goes into it.  There\\'s always going to be people who say you can\\'t do things, but obviously I\\'ve worked hard enough to get here, and I\\'m blessed. Q. And to the young kids who might be doubting themselves right now, what would you say? BEN SIMMONS: You can do anything, honestly.  You\\'ve just got to put the work in and the time.  You\\'ve just got to believe in yourself. Q. You said you now can get to work the things you need to work on.  What are some of those things specifically as you want to adapt your game to the NBA? BEN SIMMONS: Everything, from eating right to getting my body right for 82 games, to dribbling, to shooting, just everything, ball handling.  I think everything really needs to be worked on because you\\'re going to that next level where guys have been in the league for 10-plus years, so they have a lot of experience. Q. Last year when Jahlil Okafor sat here he said that Joel Embiid and texted him the night before.  Has he reached out to you at all? BEN SIMMONS: Yeah, he texted me about 30 minutes ago saying \"good luck\".  So yeah, we did talk. Q. What was it like to share this moment with your mom, your dad and your grandparents from just around the corner here in the Bronx? BEN SIMMONS: It\\'s amazing.  Seeing my dad play professionally in Australia and my grandpa, he wasn\\'t into sports or anything like that, he just worked hard.  And being able to share that with him and see where his son has gone and taken it and having me be here, and having them there is very special to me. Q. Going to Philadelphia, how much work do you think you\\'re going to have do with the team to get it potentially into the playoffs? BEN SIMMONS: A lot of work every day.  I think overall it just one of those things that takes time. Q. Seeing as how good you were at LSU at ball handling, when the Sixers met with you did they talk to you being the primary ball handler on the team? BEN SIMMONS: Definitely.  They know I can play the point forward position and I\\'m comfortable bringing the ball up, so I think that\\'s one of those things we\\'ll talk about and discuss a lot. Q. Last year at LSU you had tremendous individual success but not quite the level of team success that you might have liked to have.  What did you learn from that experience and what do you think you can bring from that into the NBA? BEN SIMMONS: Everything is not going to be perfect.  You\\'ve got to learn to fight through adversity, the struggles or whatever happens during the season, but you\\'ve got to play through it, keep working, and things change.  Players get hurt, but you\\'ve just got to play through it. Q. You mentioned your family, your father, your grandfather in the Bronx.  How much did their upbringing influence you to getting where you are today? BEN SIMMONS: A lot.  Dad, he\\'s a hard worker.  He\\'s the type of player that was a bruiser.  He wasn\\'t finesse or anything like that.  We\\'re two completely different players.  But I think the way he was raised rubbed off on me a lot. Q. Curious, what do you remember most about Allen Iverson and Pat\\'s or Geno\\'s cheese steak? BEN SIMMONS: A lot of people don\\'t know that I actually had a poster of AI when I was young in my room.  I was a big diamond-cut poster of him with the braids.  But no, I just remember him being one of those point guards, a smaller guy with braids and corn rows and the headbands.  I remember I used to have the corn rows when I was younger.  He was one of those players that fought every day. Q. Pat\\'s or Geno\\'s cheese steak? BEN SIMMONS: Which one did I have?  Oh, yeah, cheese steaks.  I\\'m going to try a lot of them.  I\\'ve got to find my spot, apparently. Q. You\\'re going to be in the NBA for quite a while.  Do you expect we should be having an NBA game in Australia, potentially in Melbourne? BEN SIMMONS: I think we should get that done definitely.  If I was a kid I\\'d definitely want to see some NBA players come to Australia, but no, that would be great. Q. Lots of pressure goes with being the No. 1 pick.  Are you ready to handle it, and are you ready to lead this team? BEN SIMMONS: Definitely.  I\\'m ready to just put in the work.  As long as I\\'m working as hard as I can, that\\'s all I can really ask of myself.'}, 'Domantas Sabonis': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=120757', 'text': \"Q.

What do you do in that time period where you have to wait for it all to work out? DOMANTAS SABONIS: Basically I was locked in a room just there.  My dad came to be there with me, so we just talked a lot, and time went by fast. Q. Finally going to the Oklahoma City Thunder, they were 30 minutes away from the NBA Finals.  How do you feel like you fit there?  Did the Thunder express any interest in you? DOMANTAS SABONIS: Yeah, Thunder expressed interest in me.  As you said, they were 30 minutes away from the Finals.  Hope I can bring that extra piece to their team which will help them succeed even more.  I'm just really excited to be there.

MALACHI RICHARDSON: I just look forward to going out there and working my tail off, trying to help that organization. Q. Did you work out for them?  What do you know about the Kings? MALACHI RICHARDSON: I was able to hang out with DeMarcus Cousins a little bit while I was out in Vegas, but no, I didn't work out with the Kings. Q. You talked about this being a whirlwind of emotions.  What's going through your head as the draft progresses and when you finally hear your name called?  What's that feeling like? MALACHI RICHARDSON: It feels like an animal being lifted off my back.  Just waiting and waiting to hear your name called is sort of crazy.  But I'm just glad and thankful I was picked by the Sacramento Kings, and I look forward to it. Q. You said people have told you you were making a mistake.  How good does it feel to prove that you didn't make a mistake? MALACHI RICHARDSON: That means a lot.  You can't really worry about what people say anymore.  They're not in my shoes, and I just got to make the best of the opportunity. Q. What are the conversations you're having with your family?  Is it just kind of trying to keep your spirits up as the picks are going by? MALACHI RICHARDSON: Just hoping I'm the next name.  It definitely helped to use my family and kept me up, but it was definitely tough sitting and waiting, but it was worth it. Q. Syracuse guy, as you go through things, everybody questions your ability to play man-to-man defense; you played zone, 2-3 the whole time.  You've probably switched around from top to the bottom of zones, you probably have more of an idea of what goes into every play in terms of positioning.  How is the lack of man-to-man on defense going to hurt you or help you for the college game? MALACHI RICHARDSON: It definitely won't hurt me.  I played man-to-man my whole life and I've been able to show that I can play man in these workouts, so just going to have to get out there and play. Q. Recent Syracuse players have been drafted and came out and haven't necessarily worked out in the league.  Do you think that's something to do with the school or is that just a coincidence? MALACHI RICHARDSON: I mean, there are a few guys that have definitely had pretty good careers.  Everyone isn't a superstar in this league, so I think that's just a coincidence. Q. It's no secret you're about to be paid a lot of money to play basketball.  Do you have any kind of special present you're thinking about buying yourself now that you got drafted? MALACHI RICHARDSON: I have no clue yet. Q. You haven't thought of anything? MALACHI RICHARDSON: Yeah, I haven't thought of anything. Q. Most of the teams or all the teams that you had worked out for, their picks had passed.  Are you kind of going through that in your mind as it's going along?  And at that point are you looking at the next few picks coming up going, who is going to take me? MALACHI RICHARDSON: This draft was a little hectic at first.  There was a lot of guys still sitting in the green room that a everyone thought would be picked earlier and there were a lot of people picked that no one really thought about.  A lot of things happened and I got slotted down a little bit, but I'm just thankful to be in this position that I'm in.\"}, 'Taurean Prince': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=120740', 'text': \"Q. Taurean, to go 12, there were a lot of people that were saying maybe you could go 9, then there was talk you were going to slide.  To actually be a lottery pick and to go in the top 12, what does that mean to you? TAUREAN PRINCE: Well, I mean, you heard different than I did.  I mean, I thought I was 20-25 range, so I mean, this is -- like I said, it's all overwhelming for me, humbling.  I've just got to work more to show people why I deserve this spot, and I'm going to do what I have to do in order to be somebody in the league. Q. Taurean, the Hawks prioritized you at the Combine interviewing you and also brought you in for their first workout.  They traded for you; picked you with the pick that they acquired in the Jeff Teague trade.  Did you feel like Atlanta was going to be it the whole time? TAUREAN PRINCE: Kind of.  Man, those guys are great, straightforward, which I love.  No gray, it's black and white type of guys, and those are the type of guys you need to be behind you, that's going to tell you when you're wrong and let you know when you're right.  I love those guys up there, man.  They brought me up for a second workout so I knew that they were really interested and we were vibing the whole entire time, and I enjoyed every single minute in Atlanta. Q. What's been your favorite part of the week so far? TAUREAN PRINCE: Just being able to be here with family.  Besides God, that's who I look to for everything in my life as far as support emotionally, and just being able to bring them out here and enjoy, and also experience the things that I'm experiencing because all this is new to me, just like it's new to them.  For them to help me growing up and to be who I am today, I'm just glad that they're able to experience everything that I am firsthand. Q. I'm sure today is obviously a big day for you.  What's more nerve-racking, the anticipation leading up to today or now knowing that you're coming to a team and being expected to contribute long-term? TAUREAN PRINCE: Man, basketball is the fun part.  I think that's what people get twisted up.  Yes, it's okay to have butterflies and be nervous, but that's the easy and the fun part.  The worst part and the hard times are grinding without those who see behind closed doors, but when the lights come on, that's the fun part.\"}, 'Jakob Poeltl': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=120742', 'text': \"Q. Delon Wright, your teammate last year in Toronto, what have you heard about Toronto from him?  And are you excited about the prospect of playing with him? JAKOB POELTL: I'm super stoked about that.  It's so great to know that I'm already going to have somebody there that I know that's my friend, and I talk to him a lot throughout this process and he's told me only good things about Toronto.  It's like an unbelievable feeling right now. Q. A fellow European center over there in Toronto in Valanciunas.  What do you expect to learn from him and how do you think you'll play together? JAKOB POELTL: I hope I can really learn a lot from him.  I think him being in a similar situation, I guess, or I guess I can learn a lot from the way he improved as a player like the path he had, I think I can take on a really similar path by learning from him, playing against him every day in practice.  It should be amazing.  I'm really looking forward to it. Q. Both of your parents played on the Austrian volleyball team.  Did you play much volleyball?  What made you choose basketball over volleyball? JAKOB POELTL: I actually started playing basketball when I was six years old, and I never really played volleyball.  I obviously played it with my parents like in my free time from time to time, but I was always set on basketball.  That was my love.  That was my sport, and they actually tried a couple times to get me over to volleyball, but there was no chance.  I was stuck with basketball. Q. Being drafted into a team that had so much success in the Playoffs last year, does that put any added pressure in you coming in and wanting to perform or does that create an environment in which you can develop into an even better player? JAKOB POELTL: I think it's an amazing opportunity for me to be on a winning team, a team that had an amazing season like the Toronto Raptors had last season.  I can learn from a lot of these guys that have had success in the NBA and are really good NBA players, and I think they can set a great example for guys like me, young guys coming in, and like I said, to be able to learn from them.  That's really what I'm looking forward to. Q. There's been talk on the workout trail that you actually emerged as one of the better shooters of the big men in your range.  How have you been working to extend your shooting range out beyond the three-point line? JAKOB POELTL: These last couple of months I've been working on it a lot.  Yeah, it's just something I never really did in college.  I didn't work on it too much.  I worked on a lot of aspects of my game, and now that I've finished the season and I've started working out, I'm preparing for the draft and the next NBA season, the Summer League.  I've started shooting a lot more, and I've noticed some quick improvement.  So I really hope I can be or become a better shooter fast and stretch the floor a little bit more. Q. Are you expecting to like immediately in the league be able to shoot from the outside? JAKOB POELTL: I mean, I'm not going to be a stretch 5 next year, but I really hope -- I'm just hoping for like a constant improvement like from year to year get better at it, get more comfortable with that 17, 19-foot jump shot.  That's so important for a big guy to be able to knock down right now.\"}, 'Georgios Papagiannis': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=120739', 'text': \"Q. Two-part question for you:  How do you feel now you're going to be going to Sacramento with Kosta Koufos, another Greek there?  And you were drafted 13, which is the highest for a Greek ever.  How do you feel about that? GEORGIOS PAPAGIANNIS: It's a great achievement for the whole of Greece.  I'm very proud of myself, I'm very proud.  I'm going to go to Sacramento and be teammates with Koufos, being with a Greek guy on the same team, it's different.  But we've got Peja, who's going to speak Greek to me, too.  So it's a great feeling. Q. (Question in Greek). GEORGIOS PAPAGIANNIS: I was so nervous before the beginning of the NBA Draft.  Now I'm so excited.  I don't believe it.  Yeah, I'm so excited to go to Sacramento. Q. Are you going to go right away? GEORGIOS PAPAGIANNIS: That's up to the team.  I want to play in the NBA as soon as possible. Q. What do you know about the Sacramento Kings?  What do you think about going there? GEORGIOS PAPAGIANNIS: I met them on the pro day.  I had the pro day like last week.  Besides that, I know Vlade Divac, European guy.  Everybody must know.  I'm very excited to be like his player.  Peja, two great players have played there.  Besides that, DeMarcus Cousins, I admire his game so much, and I love that he's going to be my teammate.  Yeah, that's it. Q. You mentioned DeMarcus Cousins.  With a player with his offensive skill set, what do you think you can learn from him, and how do you expect you'll be able to play with him? GEORGIOS PAPAGIANNIS: I've been watching him since last year.  He has a lot of skill moves in the post.  Tough, tough guy to play against.  I love his character.  He's mean for the game.  He's hungry.\"}, 'Jamal Murray': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=120743', 'text': \"Q. Your high school Coach Larry Blunt tweeted that he knew because you slid a little bit from where you thought you belonged, there would be fire in your heart from this.  Is he right about you on that? JAMAL MURRAY: Obviously.  Always.  I always believe I'm the best player, and when a team really sees the No. 1 choice, like Denver did, then I just want to play for them more.  I want to give them all I've got, and I just want to learn and be ready to compete. Q. You've got Emmanuel Mudiay.  How do you feel you'll play with him?  And talk about the Denver roster. JAMAL MURRAY: Me and Mudiay, we played in the Hoops Summit together for one year.  So I kind of got to see what he's like.  He's a great player and he's a great guy.  Family person, and we'll be a good team.  We'll be working together and playing off each other. Q. Coach Cal was all over ESPN today just singing your laurels.  What's something that he taught you that you're going to take with you to this level? JAMAL MURRAY: He taught me a lot of 2-guard stuff, coming off screens, the angle to come off of, shot selection, the different reads that are going to be there when you get to the paint.  Just a lot.  A great college decision, the best school in the NCAA, and the best coach. Q. And speaking of that best school, Kentucky has the most, by far, NBA players.  How many of those players have you spoken to? JAMAL MURRAY: A good amount.  I don't want to go through naming all of them, but great guys.  They've already been through it.  They always want to give advice, and I'm just wanting to learn. Q. Being from Italy, I have to ask you about Danilo Gallinari, your teammate.  What do you think about him? JAMAL MURRAY: Great shooter, spreads the floor well, plays hard, great emotion, someone I want to play with.  We both shoot the ball well, and it'll be cool to have a shootout with him. Q. What was going through your mind as you waited through the third, fourth, fifth picks? JAMAL MURRAY: You know, what every player waits on, you're just waiting for your name to get called.  You don't know what's behind the scenes, you don't know the trades, you don't know when the clock runs out what happens.  You're just waiting for Adam Silver to make the announcement.  So I was just patiently waiting, and I got picked up by a great team. Q. We know you're a great three-point shooter, but besides that, what can you bring to the table day one that's going to help the Nuggets this year? JAMAL MURRAY: Play-making, making that option that can pass for others and get others open with my shooting.  Just going to be an all-around player, the player that you can't leave open, the player you've got to pay attention to on the court at all times. Q. Thon obviously goes 10; how are you feeling right now about that, your old teammate there? JAMAL MURRAY: He's a great player, great person, hard work ethic.  He's going to be something special.  He wants it, and you can tell.  I love playing with guys that have the same fire. Q. Do you believe the story?  That's such an incredible story. JAMAL MURRAY: It's an amazing story.  He's an amazing player, and he deserved all of it.  I'm just happy for him.  I can't wait to see him go and get started. Q. Did you work out for Denver?  The reason I'm asking is it's a mile-high city, a lot of real big activity there.  I'm wondering if that's something of concern just getting used to being 5,000 feet up in altitude. JAMAL MURRAY: Never been to Denver other than a connecting flight.  But no, I have very good breathing.  I know how to control it.  I know what to do when I lack air.  I think I'll fit perfectly.  I'll just get better, even my meditation with that.\"}, 'Dejounte Murray': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=120758', 'text': \"Q. You're about to join a very storied franchise, San Antonio Spurs.  Can you talk about what it's like entering a team coached by Gregg Popovich and with veterans such as Tim Duncan, Manu Ginobili, Tony Parker, Kawhi Leonard.  How is that going to help your game? DEJOUNTE MURRAY: That's going to help my game a lot.  Those are all vets that you just named.  Great coach, probably one of the greatest coaches that ever coached, and I'm just excited to go learn from all the vets, pick their brains about the game, on the court, off the court and just get to work. Q. Did you work out with the Spurs prior to the draft? DEJOUNTE MURRAY: No, I actually met with them.  That was the first team I met with.  We just had a long interview and it went really well. Q. What was said during that interview? DEJOUNTE MURRAY: I mean, everything.  What every other team pretty much asked me. Q. Clearly had to be some mixed emotions there.  You had to kind of sit for a while but then it's the Spurs and a team that's vying for a championship every year.  Is it kind of bittersweet?  You had to sit so long, but the situation you find yourself in. DEJOUNTE MURRAY: I mean, like I said, yeah, I had to sit a long time, but I didn't pout.  I didn't try to show nothing negative, tried to stay positive, and I feel like I'm going to the best organization in the NBA.  Like you said, a team that contends for a championship every year.  I'm just blessed to be in a position and blessed to be a part of their organization. Q. What can you bring to a team that just won 67 games as a rookie? DEJOUNTE MURRAY: You know, high motor, like Kawhi Leonard; a dude that's willing to work, and I'll never settle for less, never get comfortable.  I love working on my game, and I feel I can help them out in anything.  I feel like my potential of doing everything and my faith and the heart I have for the game and the love I have for the game, I feel like I'll help them out really well. Q. What do you think, other than that, you can bring to the Spurs, other than that fantastic suit? DEJOUNTE MURRAY: I mean, man, I feel like I have the ability to play point guard, big, long, athletic.  I love defense.  That's why I feel like I fit right in with their program, organization. Q. What do you feel would be a success for you in your rookie season?  You're going to be on a veteran squad.  You're probably going to have to battle for playing time.  What do you think will be success for you? DEJOUNTE MURRAY: You know, just going in with the mindset that I've been having my whole life.  I've been underrated my whole life, so I went against all odds and just keep working.  Going in and learning from them, the vets, and trying to push them. Q. Can you talk about what it's like now that you'll be learning from players such as a Tony Parker and Manu Ginobili? DEJOUNTE MURRAY: I feel like it's going to help me out, help my game out.  I'm a dude that likes to do everything.  I like to score the ball, working on my jump shot.  I can get to the basket.  I like that I can make my teammates better.  I can defend.  I just do everything, and learning from them is just a bonus. Q. And I guess defense is preached very much down in San Antonio. DEJOUNTE MURRAY: Absolutely. Q. What skill do you think you need to work on most as you transition to the next level? DEJOUNTE MURRAY: Everything.  Like I said, I never get comfortable.  I could be a great shooter.  I never stop shooting, like Steph Curry.  He's a great shooter.  I'm pretty sure he still works on it every day countless hours.  I feel like I've got to work on everything as far as getting bigger, getting stronger, and in basketball, just working on everything.\"}, 'Thon Maker': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=120741', 'text': 'Q. Thon, you mentioned about playing guys with that sort of length.  Giannis obviously comes to mind.  What do you hope to learn or pick up from a player like that, playing alongside him? THON MAKER: Just first, how he jumped from that high, like when he first got drafted, everybody was like, oh, he\\'s too skinny, he\\'s this and that, he\\'s not going to do this, and now everybody is looking at him like, oh, he\\'s next.  He\\'s scary with what he can do with that length.  Just picking his mind about what he did to push him that high.  Really just picking his mind. Q. You didn\\'t get invited to the green room but you\\'re sitting in the stands.  How did it feel to walk past so many guys waiting to get their name called?  And were you surprised you were not sitting there among those players invited to sit in on the lottery? THON MAKER: When I walked past most of the guys in the green room, some of the guys looked at me sideways.  Some of the guys I already knew from high school, so we were like friends.  So they were happy and some guys gave me dap.  And other guys were like, it should be them.  I don\\'t know, if I were in that situation, I would have been like, congrats, you know, you\\'ve made a step.  Now go make a name for yourself.  Yeah. Q. There were some rumors, perhaps misinformation that was thrown about about your age.  Did that get back to you and did it anger you?  The fact that you might not be 19, that you might be as old as 23?  Can you speak to what that was like? THON MAKER: It did get to me in terms of me hearing about it, but it didn\\'t get to me personally because if it were true, I\\'d probably be like sideways about it, but it\\'s not true, so I\\'m comfortable.  I\\'m not pissed off or -- oh, I\\'m not angry or anything.  (Laughter).  I\\'ve got to learn what I can say and what I can\\'t say now. Q. Two years ago in Italy we talked about what you would be kind of at the next level.  You\\'re here.  You made the decision to come into this process later than most.  What made you think you were ready for the NBA and what do you feel like are some of the skills that are going to translate right away for you, and what do you feel like you\\'ve got to work on? THON MAKER: Well, I felt like I could bring -- people usually say nowadays that playing hard is the new skill, or having a motor is a new skill.  For me it was just always having that work ethic and just continuing to work hard.  My skills have always been just work on them, and you never know what you\\'re going to use them in the game.  So just work on them, have them in your pocket, and then when required, use them.  Just working. Q. What are some of the things you feel like you still have to work on? THON MAKER: Things like ball handling because people don\\'t expect me to be handling the ball, but look at Green at the 4 position with the Warriors.  He\\'s their new guy bringing the ball up, so it takes the pressure off the other guys because you see the 4 sucked into the paint now, and he\\'s bringing the ball up.  So he\\'s got, what, 10 feet in front of him when he\\'s bringing the ball up because the guys are not going to come out there and check him from there because he\\'s able to handle the ball.  So I feel like I need to work on that a little bit more, and shooting the ball consistently, also. Q. What are your thoughts about playing for the Boomers\\' national team and what\\'s your timetable with that and what kind of commitment do you want to make with them in terms of world championships, Olympics, et cetera? THON MAKER: Right now, it\\'s not today, because -- in terms of not this Olympic trip.  But they\\'re going to have a good year.  I feel like they\\'re going to have a good year, although they have injuries.  But for me personally, it\\'s going to take some time because I\\'ve got to get used to this first, and then after that I had already planned on eventually playing for them. Q. And thoughts, too, you\\'re the second Australian drafted early by the Milwaukee Bucks; Andrew Bogut 11 years ago.  Will you get with him and compare notes about Milwaukee? THON MAKER: Yeah, that will be cool.  That will be cool. Q. Just take me through your emotions.  There was a lot of talk of you going to play college, and then when you declared for the NBA, I\\'m sure you heard a lot of negativity.  Now to be here sitting at No. 10 in the draft, I notice you can\\'t take a smile off your face right now.  Talk about your emotions after everything you\\'ve kind of gone through. THON MAKER: It took a long time in a short time period, I can say that, because it\\'s five years -- it\\'s going six years now.  It was five years when I decided I first wanted to be a pro and take basketball serious.  So it\\'s been a long time because I\\'ve put in a lot of games, a lot of work, and to finally see it pay off, really -- I lost words.  When I was walking there, trying to say \"thank you\" to my family, just took lots of words, and I speak with them every day.  It was a different situation.  Mentally you just can\\'t wait.  Physically you\\'re trying to control yourself, and at the same time it\\'s unreal. Q. I\\'m sure if you saw the mocks you were all over the place.  What would you say to people who kind of questioned them going for you at 10? THON MAKER: I actually personally never touched up the mocks unless we were in a basketball argument with somebody else.  But somebody -- other people close by would say, oh, they have you going here.  Oh, that\\'s BS, don\\'t worry about it.  I think you\\'re this and that.  I really didn\\'t pay attention to the mocks.  But for me going 10th, I felt like my workouts, when I did the team workouts, I felt good after a few workouts, and this was one of them.  I felt great about this one. Q. You were born in Sudan when there was a lot of unrest there, then you moved to Australia, then to North America.  How much better does this moment feel knowing you\\'ve been through all of that and having your brother in the audience when you were drafted? THON MAKER: Oh, man, it was amazing.  You notice the guy was trying to rush me with a hat and I had to wait for my brother to come out.  He\\'s next, so it\\'s very special.  Last year I played an extra year just to play with him, alongside him, and that worked out pretty well, and we had fun.  At the same time, he\\'s been watching me and shadowing me all these past two, three years in basketball, and he\\'s come a long way.  He\\'s so much better, and I\\'m really happy for him, too.  He\\'s very proud of me.  So it\\'s special. Q. There\\'s a growing number of players of African descent in the NBA and even the NBA itself is making strides with connecting with the continent.  Do you have any relationships with any of the African players in the NBA? THON MAKER: Not yet.  Not yet, because I\\'ve met a few guys, and eventually plan on eventually meeting up with them and getting to know them a little bit more, but not yet in terms of personal relationships. Q. What\\'s your message to kids like yourself who came from Sudan, maybe those friends of yours who are living in Sydney or Perth or elsewhere, seeing what you\\'ve achieved? THON MAKER: Oh, some of them were texting me that they were watching, and they\\'re having the butterflies.  For some reason I didn\\'t have it before I walked into this building. I think for them, it\\'s just work hard, no matter what, and then the biggest thing that you always tell like little, little kids is work on your skills.  You never know how tall you\\'re going to be, you never know how valuable will be.  Even though you may grow out of a position, you always want to play. Q. Do you want to play for the Australian Boomers? THON MAKER: Yes, I do. Q. In Rio? THON MAKER: Not this year, no.  The veterans are going to have a last run, so they can handle it. Q. But some day you definitely want to make the Australian team? THON MAKER: I definitely do.'}, 'Timothe Luwawu-Cabarrot': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=120754', 'text': \"Q. You're 21 years old, you've been through a lot in your short life.  How do you think that moving from France to Serbia, playing with the team that you played with, prepared you for the NBA? TIMOTHE LUWAWU-CABARROT: Preparing for me the NBA?  I think it was the best transition for me to go to Serbia for a lot of reasons:  First (indiscernible), the minutes, the show.  I improve a lot over there.  There's a lot of workout, a lot of preparation for it, and I think it was the best transition for me, and that's prepared me for it. Q. What sort of support system did the team that you play for provide you and the other young players?  How would you describe it? TIMOTHE LUWAWU-CABARROT: Oh, there was a lot of players on this team, young players.  Yeah, it was a young team, and that's why there's a lot of responsibilities.  You need to be every time focused 100 percent and need to improve in your head.  You need to change your mind.  You are not the young guy of the team, and you need to play as veteran. Q. You increased your shooting percentage from long range quite a bit in the last year.  Was it just practice?  Did something click for you?  Did you change your strategy at all? TIMOTHE LUWAWU-CABARROT: Only practice.  I think for me shot ability is only about work, and it's just improving.  I think I can improve again and again, and it's going in the right way right now, so I'm going to keep working. Q. Can you talk about following in the tradition of the French influx of players that are coming into the NBA?  You're following other great French players such as Parker, Boris Diaw.  Can you speak about that? TIMOTHE LUWAWU-CABARROT: Yeah, I've spoken briefly with Tony Parker and Boris Diaw about two years ago.  Tony Parker just advised me to stay the same, be myself, and just play my game because if I'm like Boris, they like my game and don't change for something.  We just talk about that, but I guess we're going to talk a lot again for some advice. Q. Are your current plans to be in Philadelphia in the fall and play in the NBA or go back to Serbia and play there? TIMOTHE LUWAWU-CABARROT: I'm ready to play.  Like I said just before, I improved this year, and I just want to show everybody that I can play, and more now than ever. Q. The biggest sport in France is obviously fÃƒÂºtbol.  What led you to playing basketball and pursuing a career in that instead of maybe fÃƒÂºtbol? TIMOTHE LUWAWU-CABARROT: I tried to play soccer, but I wasn't good, so I just played basketball ahead of that.  So that's it. Q. The pace that your team in Serbia played was pretty fast paced.  The Colangelos who run the Sixers like to play a wide-open style and so does Brett Brown.  Are you familiar with that and do you think it suits you, the fast-paced style of play? TIMOTHE LUWAWU-CABARROT: Yeah, it was only young players.  We were running every week for that kind of game.  We just play like we should play, like running, defensive pressure, full court and all that stuff because we are young and we can do it, so yeah. Q. Do you think that a lot of teams maybe missed out on you, maybe overlooked you? TIMOTHE LUWAWU-CABARROT: If they miss me? Q. Missed out on you, that maybe you should have gone earlier in the draft? TIMOTHE LUWAWU-CABARROT: Oh, we're going to see during the summer leagues.  That's it.

I knew the staff really liked me but I didn't know if they had any first-round picks.  But I'm blessed to be part of this organization.  Blessed to be in a great city, as well.  Happy to be here. Q.

It's just a matter of rushing back right now. Q. Going to a team in Brooklyn that's probably going to take a longer road to getting to where they want to be.  They had to trade to get you essentially.  They have a lot of young guys on that roster.  Are you ready for the long haul here? CARIS LeVERT: Yes, for sure.  I'm a long-term thinker, a long-term type of guy, always have been.  I'm just excited.  I know it's a lot of work to be put in right now, but I'm just excited to get to this point. Q.

CARIS LeVERT: I'm just trying to do whatever it takes.  Next year as a rookie, I know rookies have a tougher role on the team, but I'm ready to fulfill whatever role the team needs me to do.  And then for the long haul just get better, be one of the guys for the team. Q. You mentioned all the things that you've gone through the last couple years and you got a chance to put those feelings into words a couple days ago.  How important was it for you to tell your story on your own terms? CARIS LeVERT: It was great because I feel like everybody else was telling my story and speaking for me, so I feel like that was a great opportunity for me to speak for myself, and I think it got some great reviews from it. Q. You're going to be playing here in Brooklyn.  What do you know about Brooklyn?  What do you know about New York in general? CARIS LeVERT: I know it's a great city.  I played here a couple times in college.  We played in this arena.  I'm a Midwest guy, so I'm not from far away from here, but like I said, it's a great city and I'm glad to be here.  I'm ready to work my butt off. Q. You have some famous ties to a well-known family in Philadelphia.  Talk about that. CARIS LeVERT: Yeah, well, the LeVerts are you speaking of?  Yeah, those are my third cousins, my grandfather's first cousins.  Yeah, they're from the Cleveland area. Q. Are you almost relieved to go to a team like the Nets where currently there's not many players on the roster, last year there was a lot of D-Leaguers who got big minutes late in the year?  Do you think you're going to have a sizable role? CARIS LeVERT: I'm not really sure what type of role I'll have.  Right now it's still early.  But whatever role they give to me, I'll be ready to fulfill that role.\"}, 'Skal Labissiere': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=120756', 'text': 'Q. What was it like to sit there and wait and even guys coming out of the stands picked and going to the stage? SKAL LABISSIERE: It was tough at first, but one thing about the league, one thing about all of us now, everything starts over for all of us.  We all start over once we get to that level.  I\\'m excited to get to work.  I know I have a bright future ahead of me. Q. And you said yesterday that you thought maybe five years from now you could be considered the best player in the draft.  How much did this experience maybe shape that belief? SKAL LABISSIERE: I still believe it.  I\\'m about to go to work, so I\\'m going to control what I can control. Q. Sacramento was a team that had expressed a lot of interest in you.  The idea of being in Sacramento with DeMarcus, another Kentucky guy, how do you think the fit is? SKAL LABISSIERE: I think it\\'s going to be a good fit learning from DeMarcus Cousins, Willie Cauley-Stein is there and I know him pretty well.  Rajon Rondo, who\\'s a really good point guard.  I think they\\'re going to help me a lot. Q. Does it take some of the pressure off that you\\'ve got all of those guys around you and you can go and be you? SKAL LABISSIERE: I think so, guys I like to talk to.  Like Coach Cal told me when I got drafted, those guys are your brothers now.  I\\'m looking forward to being around them and learning from them. Q. There was obviously some sort of frustrating moments there at the table.  Everybody at your table looked kind of down at different points and I know Cal did even at some points but he kept looking across the table and encouraging you.  What was he saying to you? SKAL LABISSIERE: Just that, \"You\\'re good.  You\\'re going to be fine.  You should use that as fuel to get better.\"  He told me how good I was. Q. Did you enter into today thinking this might be a possibility, that there might be an opportunity for this to happen?  Did you prepare for that, or is this sort of something that just caught you by surprise? SKAL LABISSIERE: I was prepared for anything.  Anything could happen.  I could have got picked earlier and got traded to somewhere else.  But everything happens for a reason.  I firmly believe that. Q. Now that you\\'ve come into a situation as you\\'ve discussed, where there\\'s a healthy amount of bigs on that roster, where do you focus on trying to make your impact?  What can you bring to the table Day 1 that might help you carve out your niche? SKAL LABISSIERE: My versatility.  I\\'m very versatile.  I can do a lot of different things on both ends of the floor, and I\\'m ready to go to work.  So I\\'m not going to shy away from it. Q. What do you think is going to be your biggest challenge in Sacramento?  You\\'re going to have someone like DeMarcus Cousins and other people to play with and learn from, so what will be the biggest learning experience? SKAL LABISSIERE: The biggest learning experience, I think that will be for every rookie, getting used to the speed of the game, the physicality of the game.  I\\'m going to work really hard to put weight on, get stronger.  That won\\'t be a problem for me.  Those two things I would say. Q. What do you know about Sacramento the city and the area? SKAL LABISSIERE: I\\'ve never been there, so I\\'m about to find out soon.'}, 'Brice Johnson': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=120753', 'text': ''}, 'Brandon Ingram': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=120737', 'text': \"Q. Have you thought about some of the things that you're going to do for your community? BRANDON INGRAM: Of course.  I know I definitely want to give back in different ways.  Of course start some basketball things out there.  I know I want to do something in my dad's rec gym, but do something for some schools out there.  I know those people have been big supporters for me, so of course I'm going to give something back to Kinston, North Carolina. Q. How does it fit for you and how do you feel like you're going to fit with the Lakers and the idea of playing with Julius Randle, Larry Nance, and of course D'Angelo Russell? BRANDON INGRAM: It's funny, you just named every game in a different position, and I think I fit in that mold just watching those guys over the last season and just knowing they're young guys but they're all good guys.  Just on my visit when I went to my visit, it was a great visit and it was a great workout.  I just know those guys will bring me in and we'll work very hard. Q. You're the first major move for the Lakers in the post-Kobe era and you play the same position.  Do you feel pressure to fill his shoes? BRANDON INGRAM: Yeah, you kind of feel pressure but it's a good pressure, of course.  It gives you motivation and the potential to be someone like Kobe Bryant and some of the greats in the league.  So of course, if I just go in and impact in any way I can and just listen to the coach and be coachable. Q. Is that the kind of pressure you like, to come in there and try to replace somebody like that? BRANDON INGRAM: I'm just going to be myself.  Whatever I can do to impact the game, whatever the coach needs me to do, I'm going to do it. Q. You go from Duke, now you're a Laker; that's every kid's dream.  Does it feel that way? BRANDON INGRAM: Most definitely.  I think just I grew up being a Kobe fan, of course, before I was a Kevin Durant fan.  But of course that's every kid's dream.  Just my Lakers jersey back at home, and I'm definitely going to take this ride and work the hardest I can to be the best player I can be. Q. Can it get any better? BRANDON INGRAM: Can't get any better.  Can't. Q. Speaking of your Duke days, what's something you learned from Coach K that will serve you on this level? BRANDON INGRAM: One thing from Coach K and from J.J. Redick is you're always becoming; you've never arrived.  And I use that day by day just for me to work hard each and every day, and know that no matter how good I worked out today, no matter how good I thought I was today, I can always get better and I can always be a better person.  Even Coach K thinks he can be a better coach each and every day.  So if he thinks that, I can definitely can be a better basketball player. Q. You have a relationship with Jerry Stackhouse.  Talk about that a little bit. BRANDON INGRAM: A relationship that I've groomed since about the sixth grade.  He used to come back to Kinston, of course, while he was in the NBA and he used to run little camps, and I eventually got on his AAU team and he kind of paved the way for me to create opportunities for colleges to come see me, and I think he's a big reason why I'm here today. Q. Was he disappointed you chose Duke instead of Carolina? BRANDON INGRAM: Of course you think so.  Of course I think so.  But he gave me a good response and said he's glad I made my decision, and he's happy I did it for myself and for my family. Q. What are your thoughts about playing for Luke Walton and his pace-and-space offense that he wants to bring to the Lakers? BRANDON INGRAM: Of course everyone wants to play like the Golden State Warriors, so just seeing that and seeing him coach those guys and just with the young guys that we have, the shooting ability and the passing ability for D'Angelo Russell and the different things that the Lakers do I think it's a good fit for me. Q. What's your dream NBA match-up? BRANDON INGRAM: NBA match-up?  Since I've always been a Kevin Durant fan, I would probably say Kevin Durant, but I'm just excited to go against all those guys.  None of those guys take a night off, so I've just got to expect someone to go at me and of course, for me to compete. Q. Would it be fun playing against another Duke grad like Justise Winslow or Jahlil Okafor? BRANDON INGRAM: Most definitely.  I think that that's where your competitive edge comes out, and you just try to beat them up and beat them up as much as you can. Q. Jerry Stackhouse is one of the sharpest athletes I've ever met, big believer in education.  Has he spoken with you about making sure you finish your educational side as well as being a basketball player? BRANDON INGRAM: Most definitely.  I think even when I left Duke, it was something that I talked to my adviser about, just coming back each and every summer that I could make it back or taking online classes.  No, I have a lot of downtime, and that's something I definitely want to accomplish. Q. What's your fondest memory of the Lakers?  How far do you go back?  And what do you think about Kobe Bryant? BRANDON INGRAM: Well, I was born in 1997, so it couldn't be too far, but probably Kobe's last championship.  My impression of Kobe is just his drive.  Everyone talks about how he works out, his work ethic, and that's something that I eventually want to get to, of course, and just want to talk with him and try to learn what he did to try to be what he is today.\"}, 'Buddy Hield': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=120744', 'text': 'Q. I was speaking to somebody who\\'s from the Bahamas earlier this week, how proud are you to be the third NBA player selected from the Bahamas? BUDDY HIELD: I\\'m so happy, man, not only for me but for all the kids back in the Bahamas.  The norm is that we never make it out there.  To be one of the few that make it out there, so being one of the few that makes it out there helps me give to the kids and inspire them, like okay, there will be more that will make it out there. I\\'m just happy for the Bahamas, really.  Put them back on the map, and for all my friends and family. Q. Did you get a chance to visit New Orleans?  What do you know about New Orleans? BUDDY HIELD: I know they\\'ve got a lot of good food down there.  A lot of good food, and to be honest with you, I played LSU down there with Ben Simmons.  We played down there, and they have a lot of good food.  Close to the Bahamas -- not too close, but right around the corner, but it\\'s something like home.  There\\'s beaches down there.  Not like the Bahamas beach, but it\\'s warm, so I\\'m down with it. Q. I think everyone was happy when you got your name called because everyone loves you.  Does your nickname \"Buddy\" have anything to do with the movie \"Elf\" or Will Ferrell? BUDDY HIELD: My mom, you can talk to my mom.  She\\'s by the table.  But she gave me -- back in the day she used to watch \"Married with Children\" with Bud Bundy, and she named me Bud.  She said, no, we can\\'t name him Bud because there\\'s somebody down the street named Buddy, and I didn\\'t like the person.  So they added the Buddy to it.  So it was a cool story.  She knows the whole story, though. Q. The tournament was great for you until the very end.  What have you learned since then that you need to work on and get better at? BUDDY HIELD: Work on everything.  You know, I haven\\'t watched that game yet, and I probably won\\'t watch it.  What Villanova did to us, they came ready to play.  College is so different from the NBA.  You have three guys coming at you and trapping all over the place, and NBA is different.  There\\'s more space. You can\\'t really compare college to the NBA, but I know the reason why I played so bad because I was their main focus and I didn\\'t get going and my teammates didn\\'t get going, either. You know, it\\'s a game that I can learn from, but I won\\'t watch it because it\\'s a bad taste in my mouth. Q. Yesterday we spoke at length about what it meant to you to come from the Bahamas and basically help to put the nation back on the map.  You look at yourself and you look at Skal, you look at a lot of guys that play for the Canadian national team.  About 20 years ago a lot of European players started getting drafted into the league.  Is it safe to say now that the Caribbean is somewhere that should be looked at more closely by scouts as a potential hotbed for basketball talent? BUDDY HIELD: For sure, no doubt.  I think the Caribbean has been overlooked because guys don\\'t really have the resources to get out and guys are less fortunate to make it to the U.S. and get scholarships and for people to come down and see them. You think about the Bahamas, you think it\\'s this island full of beaches and chilling on the beach, but there\\'s a lot of freak athletes down there that can play, and a lot of guys better than me who I feel like didn\\'t get an opportunity like me, but when I got my opportunity, I took full advantage of it. Q. And can you talk a little bit about your relationship with Mychal Thompson?  You mentioned him yesterday, as well. BUDDY HIELD: Yes, Mychal Thompson, he\\'s always been a good role model for us and kids back in the Bahamas, too.  It\\'s neat because he always comes down, him and Klay bring down, Klay brings some of his NBA friends down there, too.  The relationship is cool.  It\\'s a great bond, and he wanted me to go to LA.  He kept telling me, because he\\'s down in LA, but I love Mychal a lot, and I learned a lot from him, and when I get to the Pelicans, I\\'m just going to keep learning from him to better my skills. Q. How did you wind up in Oklahoma of all places? BUDDY HIELD: Funny, cool story.  I came, doing a showcase in the Bahamas.  I got picked up by this guy named Coach Kyle (Lindsted).  He asked me to come to his school and he gave me a scholarship to play for his prep team and I took it.  It was a Christian school my mom really liked the school, and we liked it.  So I started my journey down there when I was 17 years old.  And the guy Chris Crutchfield, he came to the showcase when I was like 13 years old and I was trying to showcase, trying to get looked at, and he saw me down there, and when I got older, he saw me and Oklahoma had a job.  So he told Coach Coop about me and said, \"This guy can really play.\"  I was under the radar.  Nobody really knew about me.  I had a great summer.  I\\'m AAU.  The coaches saw me.  I really chose Oklahoma because I trusted the guy Coach Crutch because I saw him multiple times, so I ended up in the right place.  It\\'s a right fit for me. Q. So they drafted you for your talent but the Pelicans, what are they getting from you as a Bahamian? BUDDY HIELD: High-character kid who\\'s going to -- that\\'s known for his basketball but also known for helping around the community, for doing whatever it takes to win.  I hate losing, and just a kid that\\'s willing to put in all the effort he needs to to make the organization better.'}, 'Juan Hernangomez': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=120747', 'text': \"Q. Juan, Denver Nuggets were at your pro day, you put on the show, and then they drafted you.  First of all, are you coming to the NBA this year?  Is that the plan?  And what was it about the Denver Nuggets and what did they say to you? JUAN HERNANGOMEZ: I don't know yet.  I don't know what happened with this summer and then with the next year.  I want to keep working, and I don't know where.  For me if I got any possibilities to go to NBA with Denver, I got it.  I love Denver.  Thank you for the team. Q. Are you excited to be coming over with your brother to start your careers together in the States? JUAN HERNANGOMEZ: Yeah, of course.  You know, when we was child, we dreaming about the NBA.  If this year we can play together, it's a dream come true.  So really, yeah, I'm really excited. Q. There's also other brothers in the league; what do you expect it'll be like to play against them if you actually do? JUAN HERNANGOMEZ: It's really different to play against your brother.  I got the opportunity to play against him in the ACB and then play together in the national team.  I don't know what happened.  He's a different player, his family, but I saw a lot of games for brothers, like I saw Gasol brothers.  So we are really proud to be the next brothers. Q. How would you compare your skill set against your brother?  What are you better at? JUAN HERNANGOMEZ: We are different players.  He's a center, me a forward.  He does really good things, and me others.  So we can't compare the two.\"}, 'Michael Gbinije': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=120768', 'text': \"Q. How did Jim Boeheim prepare you for the NBA? MICHAEL GBINIJE: I think our offense was a lot of pick-and-roll, and the NBA obviously does a lot of pick-and-roll, and just me being at the point guard position, just basically running pick-and-roll almost every other play, I think that fits the offense pretty well. Q. When people say you're going to be 24 and your age, what's your response to that? MICHAEL GBINIJE: I mean, there's pros to being 24.  You know, you learn more.  You know more going into it, battle tested, had to deal with adversity throughout my whole college career.  That's the bright side of it.  Obviously you know it's a young man's draft, but I'm just looking forward to using my wisdom and experience. Q. How did the coaching staff of Boeheim, Hop, G-Mac and Coach Adrian Autry prepare you for going into the NBA, four great coaches all with great careers?  How did that help you transition into playing in the NBA? MICHAEL GBINIJE: Just playing for a Hall-of-Famer with Boeheim in itself, USA coach, as well, you just learn a lot playing under him.  He teaches me offensively my reads at the point guard spot.  He basically turned me into a point guard.  They did a good job of developing me when I was there and just helping me grow off the court, as well. Q. When you're not really sure which teams are going to be interested in you, how does it feel to be on a contender and having a chance to play right away? MICHAEL GBINIJE: That is a great, great feeling.  I thought they put up a fight or at least competed as best as they could.  You always want to play for a team that makes the Playoffs, and Detroit is a tough team.  Got a lot of expectations for the season coming up, and it's always great to have that. Q. What are your personal expectations of yourself coming into this season? MICHAEL GBINIJE: You know, I've got to hang my hat on defense.  That's probably going to be my role, if I do play, obviously.  Just try to take care of the ball as best as possible, and if I'm open, hit a shot. Q. When you're projected to go in the second round, it's going to be a long wait.  So what's that feeling like as the draft is going along and maybe not having any idea where you're going to go? MICHAEL GBINIJE: It's a lot of anxiety.  My heart is still beating right now, and I got drafted, so you can imagine.  I have a lot of friends in the draft, so you're happy to see them going.  I rooted for Malachi, the guys in Roc Nation, as well.  Made some friends in the Combine.  So you see guys that you made bonds with get drafted.  It's always nice to see that. Q. Now that you're in the league, do you think you're going to slow down a little bit on the video games and the FIFA or are you going to focus more on basketball? MICHAEL GBINIJE: I'm definitely going to slow down.  Basketball was always the major key, and now that I'm associated with the Pistons, it's definitely my focus right now. Q. Do you have a favorite video game? MICHAEL GBINIJE: 2K now.  Looking forward to playing with myself on the next 2K, so I'm going to start practicing. Q. What part of your game do you still have to work on?  And also, what is it like making the transition from the college game into the pros? MICHAEL GBINIJE: I think the biggest transition is obviously the speed of the game.  Guys are more athletic on the next level.  You know, the game is faster, as well, mentally, so you've got to be prepared.  You've got to go into games and go into practices and just having the mindset of mature right away. Q. Who is your dream NBA match-up? MICHAEL GBINIJE: That's tough.  Wow.  I guess having a chance to match up against Steph Curry.  Just being a point guard and seeing the success that he's had over these past years, he's a guy that I definitely look up to shooting the ball-wise, and just being on the same court as him now is going to be a joy. Q. How do you think the Final Four appearance has helped you going into the NBA? MICHAEL GBINIJE: I think it's prepared me just instilling a more competitive attitude mentally.  The tournament is basically do or die, and I think the most fierce competitors really come out of that successfully.  You know, I learned a lot.  Success really comes through trial and error, and you're going to get knocked down a lot, and our Syracuse team definitely did that during the regular season.  But as long as you keep the right mindset and think positive and keep putting the work in, I think good things will come.  That's probably the biggest thing I learned from the tournament.\"}, 'Henry Ellenson': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=120752', 'text': \"Q. Henry, Stan Van Gundy, are you ready? HENRY ELLENSON: I am.  I'm going to be part of that organization.  I wasn't able to meet with him or go on a visit there, and so I'm not quite sure I'll know everyone there, but I know they're a really talented young team who's ready to get in the Playoffs. Q. Talk about the roster a little bit.  You've got Andre Drummond, Reggie Jackson, Tobias Harris, good young core there.  How do you fit in? HENRY ELLENSON: I think I can fit in and be a stretch 4 for them.  I think Andre Drummond down low is really effective and I play with centers.  So I think I can be a guy who adds a whole 'nother side of versatility there being able to make plays in the 4 spot. Q. What was the feeling like among you and your family as you were waiting for that pick? HENRY ELLENSON: Yeah, you know, it is long waiting.  I wasn't quite sure this time -- I'm like, man, am I even going to get picked?  Just dying sitting there.  But just finally getting picked, just emotions just ran through me, just all this hard work all the time.  My family sacrificed, and now hearing my name called, it meant a whole lot. Q. Was there anybody among your family who in particular helped you through this night and keep your emotions in check? HENRY ELLENSON: I'd say my whole family for sure.  Everyone knows, me and my family are huge, real close, and so everyone was just giving me a lot of positives and just encouraged me the whole night because I was getting a little uneasy there.  But just kept giving me words of wisdom, and when that pick was called, I know they were just as excited as I was. Q. Is it more so discouraging to wait to hear your name called or more exciting when you finally do hear your name called? HENRY ELLENSON: It's more exciting.  You know, I was like, right away, I was probably thinking the other way, but since I heard my name called, it just makes the whole night great.  It's something I've waited my whole life now, and now I have a chance.  I just can't wait to play in the Summer League.\"}, 'Kris Dunn': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=120734', 'text': 'Q. What was it like sitting there waiting, and what was kind of your feeling when you finally heard your name? KRIS DUNN: Yeah, you just get anxious.  You get nervous.  You don\\'t know what team is going to pick you, and once my name got heard, you could see me and my family were very emotional.  It took a long time to get to this point, and my dream is finally real, and I\\'m just happy I made my family proud today. Q. Has it kind of sunk in to you?  I know Minnesota was one of the few teams you actually worked out with.  Has it sunk in yet?  Andrew Wiggins, Karl-Anthony, what that team actually is? KRIS DUNN: Yeah, actually it kind of has.  I\\'ve been talking to Karl Towns through the draft process because he\\'s part of the agency that we\\'re with, and he\\'s a great guy.  He gave me a lot of advice through the process.  And like you said, they\\'re a young team, very gifted, Zach LaVine, Andrew Wiggins, Shabazz, Karl Towns, they have a lot of great pieces, and I\\'m just coming in ready to work. Q. Are you the guy that\\'s going to bring it all together? KRIS DUNN: I have no idea.  I\\'m just coming in to work.  Whatever happens happens.  I\\'m just blessed to be here. Q. How do you think you fit with that talent they have with Wiggins and Towns and LaVine and all those athletes? KRIS DUNN: Yeah, I think you said it right there, all those athletes.  Athletes like to play up and down, and that\\'s how my game is.  I like to play at a fast pace, that up-tempo.  We\\'re all young so we\\'re all going -- I think it\\'s going to make the relationship even stronger because we\\'re all trying to learn together, we\\'re all trying to build together, and we\\'re going to try to compete every game. Q. Kris, a Providence Friar hasn\\'t been drafted this high in some time.  What does that mean to you? KRIS DUNN: It means a lot.  Providence College is one of the best schools in the country for a reason.  The people at Providence, they believe.  They support, they show so much love, and the fact that I was able to do this not for me and my family but for everyone in Providence, it means so much because I understand what they mean to me, and I wouldn\\'t be here without none of those people. Q. Have you ever crossed paths with Matt Harvey? KRIS DUNN: Yeah, definitely with Matt Harvey.  When I played football for my high school in my freshman and sophomore year, my quarterback was Jordan Reed, who\\'s the tight end of the Redskins.  This is just the start.  There\\'s so many great talent that\\'s all over the ECC, Groton and Waterford.  So I\\'m not going to be the first of them. Q. Have you spoken with Harvey at all? KRIS DUNN: I haven\\'t spoken to him recently, but Jordan Reed definitely have. Q. What\\'s something that Coach Cooley taught you that you will carry with you to the next level? KRIS DUNN: Stay true to yourself.  You know, off the court I\\'m very goofy, I like to laugh, and I can make people smile.  He always told me, \"Never let that leave you.  Always show your personality because it definitely resonates.\"  And then on the court, \"Just keep that mentality.  Just keep being that dog because that\\'s what got you here,\" and that\\'s what I\\'m going to try to do. Q. Have you fantasized at all about playing Steph Curry, Chris Paul and some of the amazing guards in the West? KRIS DUNN: Definitely.  You know, the NBA I think is guard-dominant.  There\\'s so many great point guards in this league that you have to be excited for all of them, and you\\'ve got to bring your \"A\" game each and every game because there\\'s so many great guards.  I\\'m going to try to attack them, see where my game is at because, you know, the only way you learn how good you are is by going against them as hard as you can and see what you need to improve on in the future. Q. You shouted out JC Penney before.  Are you a frequent shopper of department stores? KRIS DUNN: Yeah, actually I do, and actually a lot of my friends do, too.  This suit is actually made by JC Penney.  The person is J. Ferrar.  It\\'s a great suit.  They did something special for me.  I told them I wanted to represent New London in a special way.  They carved some of my jersey from New London High School, and they put it in this suit, so I thought that was pretty special. Q. How much does the fact that you came back for that extra year and actually got your college degree, what kind of advantage do you think that\\'s going to give you in the league? KRIS DUNN: I mean, the first advantage is getting my college degree.  The basketball definitely is going to stop and I have something to lean on, and that\\'s my college degree and my major.  I feel like I learned more by coming back.  I learned more about the game.  I learned more about myself.  I think I became more mature mentally and physically, and I got to improve but also just to be a kid one more time before this lifestyle is going to get hectic.  I understand that.  I just wanted to be a kid one more time. Q. You\\'re going to be facing a lot in the upcoming weeks.  It\\'s going to get even crazier.  Do you think you\\'re ready for that? KRIS DUNN: Definitely.  That\\'s the reason why I went back to school.  I feel like I want to be ready for that because I think I would have still been missing school, but now I\\'m ready.  I did my four years, and it\\'s time to let go.  I understand it\\'s a business, and whatever I have to do, I\\'ve got to do it.'}, 'Deyonta Davis': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=120759', 'text': \"Q. We spoke yesterday and I asked you what would be ideal for you, to be drafted earlier or later.  Now that you had to wait a little bit longer than you expected, was it a little bit frustrating to go through that process? DEYONTA DAVIS: I mean, it was because I expected early, but the pick doesn't matter. Q. What do you look forward to now with your new team and how do you think you'll mesh with the current core of people who are on that team? DEYONTA DAVIS: I mean, I'm not a hard person to connect with, and when I get there, I'm just going to play like I'm playing with a chip on my shoulder. Q. How did Tom Izzo motivate you and help you to grow into a better player? DEYONTA DAVIS: With all the tough mistakes I made like in practice or in games, he just pulled me aside, talked to me, telling me to just keep my head up and just try not to make another mistake. Q. Speaking of Coach Izzo, I saw that he was sitting with you the entire time.  What were some of the things he was telling you to encourage you or things like that? DEYONTA DAVIS: He was just motivating me, telling me to stay positive, keep my head up.\"}, 'Petr Cornelie': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=120766', 'text': \"Q.

I spoke to you yesterday, if you remember, and I asked you, how do you feel you have to change your maturity and how will you have to adjust?  Having gone through something like this on draft night, how has your mindset changed and how are you preparing yourself for the season? MARQUESE CHRISS: Well, this taught me patience.  I mean, things happen, and you're just going to have to adjust and live with situations and just look for the best parts in things. Q. What do you expect is going to be your biggest challenge going into Phoenix, especially with all the moves they made today?  What do you think is going to be the best part of being with this team going forward? MARQUESE CHRISS: You said the best part or my biggest challenge? Q. Well, the biggest challenge and the best part mixed together. MARQUESE CHRISS: I think the best part is playing for a young team with a new coach, and I think he takes pride in developing the youth.  I don't really know what the biggest challenge will be.  I think just being on a different team and just being surrounded by people that I don't really know personally. Q. What's it going to feel like to get your first paycheck? MARQUESE CHRISS: I mean, it's going to be crazy, just a game that I've always played for free and just played for fun, and I'm getting paid for it. Q. Who was your biggest supporter growing up? MARQUESE CHRISS: Definitely my mom.  She's been there for me.  Everything that I do, she's always had my back.\"}, 'Jaylen Brown': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=120736', 'text': 'Q. When did you get a first idea that this was happening?  Obviously I\\'m sure you were aware the Celtics were engaged in a bunch of talks all day for trades. JAYLEN BROWN: I had no idea.  I promise you, I had no idea.  I was actually sweating bullets when the final five seconds came in.  But I knew they were heavily interested when they asked me to come back for a second workout, but you hear different things every day.  I mean, it changes every day, so I was not sure at all.  But I\\'m glad to be here, and I think it\\'s the right fit. Q. How does it feel to play for one of the smartest coaches in the NBA in Brad Stevens? JAYLEN BROWN: It feels great.  Brad is a great guy.  I mean, we had some conversations when I went up to Boston, and he seems like a very smart guy, so that\\'s a very fair statement. It feels great.  It feels like it\\'s an honor, it\\'s a privilege to play for somebody like that.  Good question. Q. Jimmy Butler came out and kind of endorsed you in a podcast, said he liked the way you play, the way you work.  What\\'s it like getting a compliment from one of the best two-way players in the league? JAYLEN BROWN: It feels good.  Me and Jimmy, we kind of have the same mentality.  I met him in Chicago for the first time at the NBA Combine and we have the same trainer and he said we have similar work ethics so he wanted to see for himself.  So he cut his vacation short, got in the gym with me, we worked out, and then we ended up playing one-on-one and we ended up being in there an extra hour.  We ended up going tooth and nail at it.  So Jimmy is a great worker and it\\'s an extraordinary compliment from someone like that. Q. Do you want to let us know how those one-on-one games went? JAYLEN BROWN: Sure, we played to three because I guess he thought it would be easy, and then somebody won the first game and then he wanted to keep going.  And so we kept going after that, then he won the second, then he won the third, then I won the fourth, and we ended up playing all the way to 21. Q. The NBA game is very different than the college game.  How do you feel like you\\'re going to fit into the NBA and what are the skills you feel like you can bring to the Celtics right away? JAYLEN BROWN: NBA is a faster pace, faster tempo, so it\\'s a lot of transition, and I feel like that\\'s where I excel, that\\'s where I thrive.  However, I do have to get a lot better.  Decision making has to get a lot better.  But the NBA is a faster pace, a lot of versatility.  Guys that can guard multiple positions are very valuable, and I think I add to that really well. Q. You\\'re one of the athletes that actually I think enjoyed going to class. JAYLEN BROWN: Absolutely. Q. Was this a tough decision to leave?  We know the NB riches, so I was curious if that was a factor.  And now that you\\'re going to Boston, are you looking at going to Harvard during the off-season? JAYLEN BROWN: That\\'s a good question.  That\\'s a very good question.  Anytime you make a decision you want to make sure you take your time and make sure you evaluate from top to bottom, make sure you\\'re making the right one.  So it took a while to make a decision because education is important to me, but this was the right thing for me to do, and Boston has a great history of education and some great universities like Harvard, MIT.  I\\'ve done my research, so we\\'ll see. Q. I want to talk about your draft outfit.  I like it.  It\\'s like an advanced version of Hakeem Olajuwon in \\'84.  Walk me through it.  What made you choose that one? JAYLEN BROWN: This is the one that kind of popped out.  I know a lot of young guys tend to go with flashy colors or fluorescent patterns or floral patterns.  I just wanted to keep it simple, classic, timeless, but definitely, definitely classy.  That\\'s what I wanted to do.  That matches my personality, so I expressed my personality through my suit. Q. How many suits did you have to choose from? JAYLEN BROWN: How many suits did I have to choose from?  I had thousands of suits to choose from.  Thousands.  And I\\'m super meticulous and picky.  So I had to make sure.  I had to do my due diligence on suits, so it took me a while. Q. On those visits did you have a chance -- were any players around at those workouts?  And how familiar are you with their team and what can you bring to their team as you join it? JAYLEN BROWN: No players were in when I was in either time, but I know a few of them.  I know James Young went to Kentucky.  I don\\'t know him personally but I know of him, and Isaiah Thomas, the point guard, I know he\\'s really close with the actual Isiah Thomas.  So that relationship is probably going to be set when we get there and everything, but that\\'s about it. I don\\'t know really anybody on the team, but I do know that they\\'re a playoff team and they\\'re looking for somebody to come and add and not take away from what they\\'ve been doing, so that\\'s what I want to do. Q. Can you take us into your mind, what happened in your mind when you first arrived here, then when you hear your name called, then when you go on the stage to shake the hand of the Commissioner? JAYLEN BROWN: What was going through my mind?  I didn\\'t think Boston was going to pick me for some reason.  I don\\'t know.  I was sitting there and I was nervous as all get-out.  Somebody texted me and was like, \"Didn\\'t hear anything from Boston.\"  They were obviously playing a joke on me, but I was sweating and I was nervous.  But when they picked me, just a sigh of relief left me, and I\\'m happy I\\'m here. Q. You\\'ve mentioned history a few times.  What are your earliest memories of the Boston Celtics? JAYLEN BROWN: My earliest memories?  Earliest memories go back to -- do they have to be alive? Q. To have memories, yes. JAYLEN BROWN: True, true, true.  Only team I\\'ve got to see in person was 2007 with Paul Pierce, KG. Q. \\'08, the championship team? JAYLEN BROWN: \\'08, the championship team.  But I remember watching the Big Three.  That\\'s the earliest memories I have, but of course I know about the Celtics in \\'86, \\'87, \\'88 those years they were unstoppable and then going back to Bill Russell and those days, as well.'}, 'Ben Bentil': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=120767', 'text': \"Q. You did not work out for the Celtics; is that correct? BEN BENTIL: No. Q. Any feeling of how the night went?  Obviously you had high hopes probably to go even in the first round I would imagine? BEN BENTIL: I mean, things just didn't go the right way or whatever, but God has a plan, and everybody in this draft needed opportunity.  Whatever chance you get, first round or second round, you've just got to take advantage of the opportunity, and I'm glad I got one, so time to prove myself. Q. How excited are you to stay in New England? BEN BENTIL: I'm excited.  It's home.  New England is home for me.  I still have Providence right next to me, so I can go back and forth.  At the end of the day, I'm very grateful for the opportunity. Q. You've talked about that, that you wanted a chance.  That's pretty much what this is? BEN BENTIL: Yeah, I just needed a chance. Q. Now that you're going to have so many top-tier teammates and have so many people to learn from and play with, who are you looking forward to teaming with and learning from in this upcoming season? BEN BENTIL: I mean, going to Boston, they're great players, great coaching staff, and I'm just going out there and doing what Coach asks me to do.  Try to be a great teammate, try to make the team, and take advantage of the opportunity again. Q. How fortunate do you feel that you're going to be playing for a contender when later in the draft sometimes you're not really sure where you're going to go and then you get an opportunity? BEN BENTIL: I mean, once again, I'm excited and I thank the Boston Celtics organization for giving me a chance.  But at the end of the day, I'll still go and show them what I've got and give it my best. Q. Did your mom make it over? BEN BENTIL: Yeah. Q. How special was that? BEN BENTIL: Very special.  You know, she didn't know -- she had no idea what was going on, but at the end of the day, just trying to make her proud.\"}, 'Dragan Bender': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=120735', 'text': 'Q. Do you like the nickname \"Croatian Sensation\"? DRAGAN BENDER: Yeah, I\\'ve heard it a lot.  I like it for sure.  But yeah, like you said, I like it.  I\\'ve heard it before also a couple of years.  So far it\\'s a great nickname. Q. Do you ever hit your head on doorways and ceilings? DRAGAN BENDER: When I was younger probably I did.  I did, yeah, of course.  But then you just get used to it, you know.  So you need to take care of that. Q. Back-to-back years a Croatian has been drafted in the top five.  What does that mean to you and what does that mean for your country back home? DRAGAN BENDER: It means a lot, just in terms of the work in Croatia, the national team, and just overall in Croatia.  I think there is even more guys that are coming right now that are huge talents, and just looking forward for those guys to come overseas and to build really good Croatian connections and start to build a great national team for that and to win some championships, you know. Q. Toni Kukoc was one of my favorite Croatians.  Did he have any impact on you growing up and any advice or even just watching him growing up, was he one of your favorite players? DRAGAN BENDER: For sure, he was my role model growing up.  I was playing in a club and he was playing, also, so playing in that same gym and feeling that same atmosphere was a great experience.  And just watching all the tapes, him playing in Jugoplastika when they won three titles and then he was in Benetton Treviso, and then coming overseas with the Chicago Bulls and winning the titles with them, he was a great player overall and he was somebody I was looking up to growing up. Q. I notice everyone is wearing a bowtie.  Tell me about yours.  It\\'s different. DRAGAN BENDER: I guess it\\'s a new generation thing.  It\\'s great.  It\\'s cool.  I guess it\\'s just a new generation thing. Q. You\\'ve been compared to a player who was drafted in last year\\'s draft and plays for the Knicks:  Kristaps Porzingis.  Do you think that\\'s an accurate comparison?  What similarities do you have to him and his game? DRAGAN BENDER: Right.  I guess people are going to compare European talents to European talents, the same that when he came there, comparing to Dirk Nowitzki and guys like that.  So I guess this is a normal thing for them. Besides that, we are coming from Europe and both seven-footers that can shoot from outside and move the body.  I guess that\\'s the only things that are similar.  But we\\'re definitely different type of players.  He\\'s two years older than me, a lot more experience, so in that part, also, we are different. Q. Dragan, Phoenix Suns, looks like Marquese Chriss may be coming with you.  A bunch of young guys in Phoenix.  Do you feel like that\\'s a good thing for how you play?  And what do you feel like your game is going to be like for the Phoenix Suns? DRAGAN BENDER: I mean, it\\'s always good for young guys that there\\'s a couple guys on the team that are the same age.  It\\'s a good thing for Phoenix for sure, for the organization and for the future, and also for practice, you always have someone -- young guys on the practice that you can battle with them and just go each and every day against each other.  I think it\\'s a great thing, and looking forward in the future, I guess it\\'s going to be a really good thing in the long-term. Q. Going from the Negev Desert to the Sonora Desert, can you talk about Israel and how you\\'re looking forward to going to Phoenix? DRAGAN BENDER: Right, I guess it\\'s pretty similar weather in Israel and Phoenix.  It\\'s pretty hot during the year and in the summer.  So I guess that\\'s a good thing for me.  But it\\'s a totally different city, bigger city and everything, different style of life for sure.  I enjoyed life in Tel Aviv and I enjoyed life in Israel overall, great people, especially the great club I was playing in.  I really enjoyed it, so I\\'m just looking forward to Phoenix and will try to enjoy it over there.'}, 'Malik Beasley': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=120751', 'text': \"Q.

Do you know any of the players on that roster, have any relationships there? MALIK BEASLEY: Not really.  I know a few guys by name but nothing too serious. Q. The Nuggets also took Murray, who's also a guard.  Are you afraid coming to such a loaded roster that you're going to have a hard time getting shots and have your development slowed down a little bit? MALIK BEASLEY: Not really.  I'm still going to work hard, compete against him.  We're friends, and we're going to work hard together to get Denver back on again. Q. Obviously going to Denver the air is a lot thinner.

Mike Conley, an established point guard with the team, may not be back which means you may have to shoulder a lot of responsibility early in your career.  Is that something you can handle and you welcome or do you not look at it like that? WADE BALDWIN IV: I welcome anything that comes by.  I think I need to establish myself first and get with the team and understand my role and do that role to the best of my ability. Q. Wade, Memphis is known as the Grindhouse.  They play defense.  You've got the bigs.  You mentioned yesterday that you're a versatile player.  Are you ready for that level of defense and to throw the ball into the big fellas? WADE BALDWIN IV: I think I'm ready, and like I said before, I just want to get a part of that program and see how it is before I make a bold statement like that.  I'm flexible and versatile in whatever the team needs me to do, and whatever that is, I'm going to do it to the best of my ability. Q. What do you think you're going to bring to a locker room filled with veterans? WADE BALDWIN IV: Just a loyal guy, an honest person and somebody that oozes with positivity.  I'm playing with guys that are awesome, fantastic players:  Marc Gasol being one of the best centers in the league.  Zach Randolph, very good veteran.  Mike Conley, terrific point guard.  Tony Allen probably will go down as one of the best defenders of all time, even Kobe said it.  I mean, it's awesome. Q. Your high school team, Karl-Anthony Towns, first pick in the NBA Draft, Rookie of the Year.  Your other teammate James Ziemba just selected by the Philadelphia Phillies as a left-handed pitcher.  You being selected in the first round of the NBA Draft.  What was it about St. Joe's  Metuchen that really prepared the three of you guys for professional careers? WADE BALDWIN IV: I think it allowed us to put egos aside.  On that team we had such great talent, five Division I guys, and you have to sacrifice who you are and how you want to play.  You have to sacrifice points for what's best for the team, and using that, I translated it into college, and now I'm here, and I continue to use that same mentality, that same approach.  Whatever team I'm on, it's about sacrifice, and those are the teams that I think do very well. Q. How does it feel to be picked in state to be able to play so close to where you played in college? WADE BALDWIN IV: Oh, it's awesome, man.  I mean, I picked Tennessee being a great state, good weather.  I've been to Memphis before.  It has rich history.  I couldn't be happier with the place that I'm at. Q. What do you think you learned from playing under Kevin Stallings at Vanderbilt that can help you transition into playing for Memphis? WADE BALDWIN IV: I think I learned a lot of IQ things, being an honest person, being coached hard, coached direct.  You need to know what you need to do before the game and go out and execute it, bring that mentality that Coach Stallings had can just be awesome for me moving forward. Q. What was the process of waiting in the green room and finally hearing your name like?  Was it a lot of tension, a lot of nervousness?  And when you did finally hear your name what was that like? WADE BALDWIN IV: Oh, absolutely.  It was things that went up and down and places where I thought I was going to go and then I didn't go.  My focus was just on where am I playing Summer League at.  I can't wait to go back and play five-on-five against competition.  That was really in my head.  I just wanted to be picked.  It didn't matter what team it was.  I'm super, super, super ecstatic it was the Memphis Grizzlies.\"}}, 2017: {'Jayson Tatum': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=131239', 'text': \"Q. When Danny Ainge traded the No. 1 pick, he said he was going to get the guy he was going to take No. 1 overall anyway.  That's you.  How do you feel about that? JAYSON TATUM: That's a great compliment, especially with all the great guys in this class.  The two guys that went ahead of me, they're great players, but I'm glad at how it worked out, so I'm happy. Q. Looking back to when you were a kid, how hard was it to get to this point, and what do you want to accomplish now? JAYSON TATUM: It was extremely tough, you know, getting to where we are now, and all the guys in the green room can really relate to all the hard work and sacrifice that it took to get here.  Now this is like the beginning, and there's so much more ahead that I want to accomplish, and I'm excited I get to do it with the Boston Celtics. Q. You had a lot of fun at your table with your family, with your little sister.  How important is your family and most of all your little sister for you? JAYSON TATUM: Family is the most important thing.  They've been with me my entire life, before I was going to be in the NBA, and they've helped me and been with me the entire way.  There's nobody else I'd rather share it with than them. Q. What do you know of Boston based off of workouts and the interview process leading up to this, and what did Mike Krzyzewski perhaps tell you about the coach Brad Stevens is?  Obviously they famously met back in that National Championship game in 2010. JAYSON TATUM: Coach K talked to me -- we talked a lot during this process, but I think it was like right after they traded the pick.  He called me and talked about that Boston wanted me to come up there for a workout, and he was just ranting about how great of a person Brad Stevens is, and that Coach K would love the opportunity if they would pick me, and he really wanted me to go up there and work out for them.  I was all for it.  It worked out.  I had a great time up there on my visit, and obviously they enjoyed me. Q. Just that one year at Duke that you had with Coach K, obviously a little bit of an up-and-down roller coaster.  What was maybe one thing you learned throughout the year that you want to take with you heading into the NBA? JAYSON TATUM: Oh, man, Duke was a great time for me.  There's so many things that I learned, especially from Coach K.  I think just his passion and the confidence he gave me throughout Duke and how much he believed in me as a player, and when somebody like that believes in you, then it takes your game to a new level. Q. Jayson, you're playing for the Boston Celtics right now.  You grew up as a Kobe Bryant fan.  Describe the moment when you first fell in love with the game of basketball. JAYSON TATUM: As long as I can remember.  Probably age 3, 3 or 4 years old, just Kobe Bryant has always been my favorite player, and I think he's one of the biggest reasons why I fell in love with this game. Q. Most guys that go top three end up on a bad team, lottery team.  You're joining a contender, No. 1 seed in the East.  How exciting is that for you to go to a winning situation right away? JAYSON TATUM: It's great.  I think that I get to learn that much more, especially from a veteran team that knows what it takes to get there.  I can't wait to go and learn from Coach Stevens and Isaiah Thomas and just everybody on that roster. Q. How did you find out you were picked tonight and have you had any communication even now with anybody on the team? JAYSON TATUM: I had no clue.  The only indication I had was right before he called my name, all the cameras came to my table.  So I was like, this is a pretty good sign.  (Laughter). Q. Have you had any communication already with Danny or Brad, any text messaging or talking to them? JAYSON TATUM: I'm sure my agent has, but I haven't talked to them since I left Boston. Q. What was the emotion, can you give us a play-by-play what happened at the table when your name got called and what was that emotion like? JAYSON TATUM: Oh, man, it was the best feeling I've ever had in my young life, and I'm only 19.  It was the day I've always -- the moment I've always been dreaming about and waiting for.  It was as special as I could have imagined and that much more. Q. Who did you hug?  Was it your mom first? JAYSON TATUM: Oh, yeah, my mom.  I had to hug my first mom. Q. And then? JAYSON TATUM: My dad and both my grandmas and my agent. Q. I was just wondering, do you have any prior relationships with any of the players on the Celtics?  Have you talked to them at all? JAYSON TATUM: The only person I know is Jaylen Brown.  He's close to my age, and we were in a couple AAU camps when we were in high school, so that's where I know him from. Q. Do you think that'll be a helpful person for you going into your first season, to kind of pick his brain? JAYSON TATUM: Yeah, I'm sure, as any other guy on the roster.  They've all been through what I'm about to go through, so they can all be helpful. Q. Duke athletes are not only terrific but they're also pretty good students.  I know you told me yesterday that you kind of knew you were leaving after one year, but you're only 19.  Do you plan on continuing your college education in the near future? JAYSON TATUM: Yes.  Yes, I do.  Exactly when, I'm not sure, but yes. Q. Will it be at Duke?  They've got a lot of fine schools in your new place of work. JAYSON TATUM: I hope it's at Duke.  Yeah, that's where I'd love to graduate from.\"}, 'Dennis Smith, Jr.': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=131248', 'text': \"Q. Dennis, talk about what you'll bring to your new team, please. DENNIS SMITH, JR.: I'm thankful to be a part of the Dallas Mavericks organization, and I'll be a point guard to come in and just compete and try to win every game that I can. Q. Did you speak to Mark Cuban at all?  He's a very hands-on guy, so I was curious if you got to spend some time with Mr. Cuban. DENNIS SMITH, JR.: No, sir, I haven't.  I haven't got to spend time with him but they sent a couple times to my pro day.  I got to speak with Donnie Nelson and I got to speak with Coach Carlisle, and those meetings went pretty well, so I guess they're basing it off that. Q. Dallas Mavericks going in a kind of really new direction, Harrison Barnes, Nerlens Noel, now you.  Have you thought about how that team plays?  And you'll still have Dirk around. DENNIS SMITH, JR.: It'll be great.  If you look at the history of the Dallas Mavericks, they've been a great team for a very long time.  They have great guys there, Mark Cuban, Coach Carlisle and Dirk, and like you said, they have Harrison and Nerlens, they both did pretty well last year, and I think I can only add to that. Q. What do you feel like you bring to that equation because both of those guys, certainly in Dirk and Harrison can really score. DENNIS SMITH, JR.: I think I can help them.  I can give them four extra points apiece at least, and I can play both ends of the ball and I can add a lot to the pick-and-roll game. Q. Is there anybody in the NBA you look forward to playing against?  And at this moment, what do you need to work on the most to get better in the NBA, to have a good NBA career I should say? DENNIS SMITH, JR.: I look forward to playing Chris Paul, Derrick Rose, Russell Westbrook because those are three guys I try to model my game after in a while.  In the NBA the biggest thing I can work on in terms of making the transition is definitely conditioning because it's an 82-game season and 48 minutes a game.  That's way different than college, and I can learn a lot about the game, to make me the best player I can be.  I need to learn that as soon as possible. Q. Can you talk about playing with Dirk, about this feeling for you, having him on your side. DENNIS SMITH, JR.: It's a blessing.  He's one of the great scorers, one of the greatest power forwards that we've ever seen, so to be able to play with Dirk Nowitzki and learn a lot from him is a blessing for me, and I believe that it can only enhance my basketball career.\"}, 'Justin Patton': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=131253', 'text': \"Q.

I've been there a lot of times.  And to start off with the team, it's a great team, and with the acquisition of Jimmy Butler, there's more great things happening. To Minnesota I'll bring a good versatile big man who can either play the 4 or the 5, who's great at passing the ball and has a high IQ and a great teammate.  That's where I want to start off. Q. What do you make of the possibilities that you and Karl-Anthony Towns to form? JUSTIN PATTON: It's amazing, like it could be anything.  It could be anywhere from him playing the 4 or me playing the 4 or vice versa with the 5.  It's amazing.  Coach Thibs has a hard time right now figuring out what he's going to do. Q. You're a seven-footer who shot over 60 percent from the field, over 50 percent from three.  What haven't we seen that everybody is about to see in the association from Justin Patton? JUSTIN PATTON: I would say my ability to put the ball on the floor and my ability to make my own shot.  Like KAT at Kentucky he didn't really do what he was doing now, so hopefully when I'm in the league I can be able to showcase some things. Q. When the Jimmy Butler trade went down, did you ever think in your head, it might be nice to land with the Timberwolves? JUSTIN PATTON: No, not really.  The Timberwolves is a great team.  I've watched them, being from Omaha, being the closest team I was able to watch them.  They're a great team, and anybody would like to go there I'm pretty sure. Q. Did you work out for the Timberwolves?  Did you know this was a possibility? JUSTIN PATTON: No, I didn't work out.  I actually had an interview in Chicago with them, and it went really well. Q. Just take us to the table.  What were your feelings like as you watched the thing progress, and how did you find out officially that you were going to get picked? JUSTIN PATTON: People assumed that I was nervous.  I wasn't really nervous.  I was excited to see where I got picked because I was waiting to see if I was going to go super low or whatever.  It's really where my starting point was at was going to determine how the night was going to go.  So really I was excited to see what I was going to start.  And I am ready to work my way up.  I am with Minnesota, so I am going to work my way to be the best from there. Q. Was it a blur after your name was called and you hugged your family, flashed the jacket? JUSTIN PATTON: Yeah, it was really a blur.  Now that you ask me, I really don't remember.  It was great being there with my family and even the family in the crowd and Coach McDermott and for Omaha, too.  This a great opportunity for me. Q. You did know you were getting picked before your name was called? JUSTIN PATTON: Yeah, I did. Q. What was going through your mind? JUSTIN PATTON: My mind was racing.  I was thinking about all the possibilities that could happen in Minnesota and my future teammates and Coach Thibs.  It was great to know earlier. Q. When you think about the Big East Conference, and Creighton as a newer member but this is a league that has produced some all-around greats through the years.  To be the first Big East player drafted in this draft, what does that mean? JUSTIN PATTON: It means a lot to me.  I owe it all to my coaching staff, my family in Omaha just because they prepared me for this moment.  Being in the Big East, being up here, the media training and all that type of stuff.  It's been great.  Yeah, it's really been great.  That's all I can say. Q. This Minnesota team has been on the rise for the past couple years.  What are you going to bring to them that they don't already have? JUSTIN PATTON: I would say me being on the team is a step in the right direction just because the ability with which I pass the ball and my IQ for the game, not many people at my size can do things I do with the ball, whether it be making a play on the offensive end or the defensive end, whether it's rotating and blocking a shot or being able to be in the right spot at the right time, just knowing the game.  I would say the biggest thing is my IQ.\"}, 'Anzejs Pasecniks': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=131256', 'text': \"Q. Can you start out with an opening statement, what you'll bring to the Magic? ANZEJS PASECNIKS: I mean, at the moment, my game, like European basketball, like on offense, we share the ball, we do a lot of pick-and-roll at the moment, but I think in a couple years or in a couple months I'm going to improve my game one-on-one.  So that's what I'm going to do at the Magic. Q. Seems like the reports are that you've been traded to Philadelphia.  Have you had any conversations with them at all or any workouts with them in the pre-draft process? ANZEJS PASECNIKS: No, actually that's likely surprised me. Q. What do you think you need to work on in your game to improve yourself? ANZEJS PASECNIKS: Actually I have to improve everything.  I have to improve my skills, my physicals, like my legs, my body, so those are the main things, and that's what I have to concentrate at the moment. Q. What is your contract situation overseas?  Do you have any plan in that regard? ANZEJS PASECNIKS: I have a contract with Gran Canaria for two more years, so at the moment that's all I know, and I'm thinking just about that. Q. Growing up in Latvia, were you able to watch NBA games easily?  Is there someone that you tried to model your game after as a young kid? ANZEJS PASECNIKS: I was like all kids, I was watching LeBron, Kobe, Durant, Allen Iverson.  I was hoping one day I'm going to be there, too, and now I'm hoping that one day other kids are going to watch my top moments and think that he wants to be like me one day. Q. Do you know anything about the current Sixers organization, what the team is looking like, anything about them specifically? ANZEJS PASECNIKS: Like I said, I didn't talk to them, so I don't know much.\"}, 'Frank Ntilikina': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=131249', 'text': \"Q. Frank, would you please start with an opening statement about what you'll bring to the Knicks. FRANK NTILIKINA: What I will bring to the Knicks, actually a lot of hope.  I think I'm a player who will trust the process, work hard, and definitely try to be the best player I can be, who will give energy.  I think I'm a team point guard and shooting guard actually.  I'll just try to make my teammates be better every day, and I think I can play defense, too. Q. The Knicks have had very great success with international players, young players with Kristaps Porzingis lately.  Do you think that helps with this environment in New York? FRANK NTILIKINA: Yeah, yeah, for sure.  To be drafted and to play in a place that already has international players is just great to adapt to the environment, like you said, and I think to play with them, to have a lot of advice of how they feel, how they felt on the court, how was their rookie season, it's just like great for me. Q. Frank, I know this is all coming at you pretty quickly, but can you imagine what it will be like the first time you step on to the Garden court as a Knick? FRANK NTILIKINA: Actually you can't realize until it happens.  Like I've been actually playing my season with my team back in France, and when the last game, the fourth game with my team ended, like I just thought to realize I was getting drafted in two days, you know.  More and more the emotion started to come into my head and into my body, and when I heard my name, it was just great.  It was just a blessing.  It was actually a lot of motivation to me to go in the gym and work harder.  So I think you can't even realize how it will be to hear your name. Q. Frank, you started your professional career in France actually in 2015 when you were only about 17 years old.  How has that experience made you more prepared for what you have in store in the NBA? FRANK NTILIKINA: I think it definitely helped me to play against grown men, adults, and to play against some of the guys that went into the NBA actually.  Like I had teammates that played in the NBA, former Mavs Rodrigue Beaubois, former Knick Mardy Collins, so actually every teammate can help you to make the transition, young championship to the professional championship actually, so it helps a lot. Q. You said that you played with Rudy Gobert when you were in France? FRANK NTILIKINA: Rodrigue Beaubois. Q. Have you spoken to any of the French players in the NBA to see what their experience has been? FRANK NTILIKINA: Not that much.  We're all trying to get focused, to be focused on our season.  Definitely now off-season, I've received already some messages and a lot of support from them, like French basketball.  We are all family, so we definitely try and help everybody.  So I know they will be here for me, and it's just great, great to them. Q. For those that haven't watched you play, what will you bring to the New York Knicks?  What is your game? FRANK NTILIKINA: Like I said first, I think great defender, willing to defend, willing to play hard, and to give intensity to the team and the offense.  Like I'm a team player.  I always try to give the best to the team no matter what happens.  To me the most important thing is to get the win.  I like to shoot it, to pass it, and then play pick-and-roll. Q. What is your knowledge of the triangle offense?  That's something that Phil Jackson has made his prize baby over his career.  Do you know a lot about that and what are your impressions of it? FRANK NTILIKINA: Definitely we talk about it.  You know, I've been watching a lot of NBA games.  I know that this is the system that brings him a lot of championships, definitely.  I think the play that -- the system that I played back in France with my team is quite similar with it, and we talk about it together, and I think I can definitely fit with this system. Q. I was wondering, can you divulge any of your conversations with the Knicks and just kind of elaborate on what you anticipate your role to be next year?  Is it point guard?  Is it coming off the bench, or do you see yourself as a hybrid in the triangle? FRANK NTILIKINA: You know, we didn't get that far.  I think it was a short meeting that actually was -- just to talk about how I was as a man.  They wanted to know me.  I didn't do any workout.  They wanted to know how I am.  I think me personally, I'm ready to play point guard, play shooting guard.  We'll see what happens after. Q. Frank, I'm wondering about your childhood in France.  Here in New York City basketball is often played in public parks, and New York is famous for producing point guards who hone their skill in these competitive games, pickup basketball games.  I'm wondering if any such thing exists in Strasbourg and if you could say anything about when you fell in love with the sport when you were a kid? FRANK NTILIKINA: I fell in love with the sport when I played with my brother and actually we played a lot in the park.  Definitely I was trying to get -- I was trying to play basketball every day, and when I couldn't with my team, I was every day going to the park trying to play. Q. Which park? FRANK NTILIKINA: Close to my city, close to my house.  It's called la Citadelle. Q. How excited are you at the prospect of playing with Kristaps Porzingis?  And there have been trade rumors around him.  Do you think it would be a mistake for the Knicks to let him go? FRANK NTILIKINA: I don't know.  Definitely just to play with him would be great, I think.  Like I said, I'm just trying to get my teammates to be better, and like we're both European, we both have a good IQ and play pick-and-roll with him will be great.  But actually I just know that I will play great with him. Q. You already have an A+ on the suit. FRANK NTILIKINA: Thank you. Q. Who's the designer, if there is one?  Who helped you with it? FRANK NTILIKINA: I was working with it back in France with a tailor.  Yeah, we worked on it together. Q. How long ago did you start putting it together? FRANK NTILIKINA: Three months maybe. Q. When did you get the first indication that you would be selected by the Knicks? FRANK NTILIKINA: Actually when I heard my name.  I just -- yeah, yeah, I just like asked my agent and my family to keep it for them.  I just wanted to leave the process of the draft, like I wanted to leave it, just know where I would be just hearing my name, so when I heard it. Q. You have a big game in France tomorrow. FRANK NTILIKINA: Yeah. Q. What has this week been like for you? FRANK NTILIKINA: Crazy, crazy exciting.  Like I think that's what we play for, basketball, to have a lot of emotion, and definitely this week is one of the craziest weeks I've been through in my whole life, trying to get the championship tomorrow, so definitely great. Q. At what age did you start to play basketball, and how did you pick it up? FRANK NTILIKINA: When?  The age of 4, actually. Q. Why four?  Was it your brother? FRANK NTILIKINA: Yeah, yeah, my brother, we started playing basketball in the park one day.  They brought me to just have some fun outside. Q. I was wondering if you spoke to Phil Jackson at all in your pre-draft interview, and how did that go, meeting him? FRANK NTILIKINA: Yeah, yeah, it was great.  I spoke to him yesterday actually, and it was great to talk with him.  Actually I think -- I thought when I went out of this meeting that it was one of the right places for me to be to improve as a player.  Like I said, trusting the process.  So yeah. Q. How long did you guys speak for? FRANK NTILIKINA: A long time. Q. There's a lot of stuff going on at the Knicks at the point guard position, so you may or may not be in a starting role.  How would you feel about backing up and maybe having to work harder to start? FRANK NTILIKINA: I think it's really exciting to have challenges right at the beginning of your career, like it's really exciting.  I mean, I'm ready for whatever will happen.  Like I said, just to hear my name tonight gave me a lot of motivation, and I think I'm ready for whatever will happen, definitely.\"}, 'Malik Monk': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=131246', 'text': \"Q. Malik, can you start out with an opening statement about what you'll bring to the Hornets? MALIK MONK: Oh, yeah.  A winner.  I'm a winner.  Always trying to win.  Do the best I can to win and knock down open shots, any shot I can get, all the clutch shots.  I try to make the best, and I'm going to learn, learn from the vets and listen to the coach and try to be the best player and best listener and learner ever. Q. You were drafted by the Hornets.  They have a great scorer in Kemba Walker.  You're also a great scorer.  How excited are you to play with someone that scores the ball as well as Kemba Walker? MALIK MONK: I'm just excited to play basketball, but being with him, too, I watched him a lot in college when he was with UConn and modeled some of my stuff after his game - I got the stepback from him.  So I'm just thankful to be in this situation, and hopefully it'll work out good. Q. Did you think the Knicks might take you at 8?  And was it at all disappointing that you kind of fell to 11? MALIK MONK: I actually thought the Knicks would take me, but nothing is disappointing about getting drafted.  This has been my dream forever, and nobody ever from my town ever been drafted, ever made it this far, so I'm just thankful to be here. Q. Do you think this will give you a chip on your shoulder at the next level? MALIK MONK: For sure.  (Laughter). Q. Why? MALIK MONK: I can't tell my secrets. Q. Malik, you go play next to Kemba, a team that desperately needs three-point shooting, Dwight Howard has already been on Twitter saying you're a great addition.  How do you feel about kind of the environment you've just found yourself in? MALIK MONK: Yeah, everybody is comfortable.  Michael Jordan is the GOAT, and he's with Charlotte, and I'm going to learn a lot from him, and everybody -- like I said, everybody is comfortable.  Kemba is comfortable because he's with my agency.  I talked to him before, and everybody is comfortable, just like me.  So I'm just ready to get to work. Q. Is there an NBA player that you try to model your game off of? MALIK MONK: When I was younger I watched a lot of Russell Westbrook, but I really don't model my game after anybody now. Q. As you mentioned Michael Jordan is there.  How exciting is it for you to be able to learn from the greatest player of all time who also plays your position, and how much do you think that will add to your game? MALIK MONK: I still can't believe it right now.  I still can't believe it.  Maybe tomorrow I'll believe it.  But I think he'll teach me a lot and I'll take an even bigger step each year.  Each year I'm going to try to learn as much as I can from him. Q. Do you have any goals or expectations for yourself in your rookie season? MALIK MONK: Like I said, learn, learn a lot.  But I'm trying to be Rookie of the Year, get to the Rookie Game and All-Star Weekend.  It's a lot of goals I'm going to set. Q. Your owner is still pretty competitive.  Do you think he's going to challenge you to a one-on-one game when you get down there?  And if so, are you going to do the political thing or are you going to try to beat him? MALIK MONK: I'm going to beat him.  (Laughter). Q. What town are you from? MALIK MONK: Lepanto, Arkansas.  It's Northeast Arkansas.  It's close to Memphis, like 30 minutes from Memphis. Q. So it's not far from Little Rock? MALIK MONK: Yeah, it's like an hour and a half, two hours from little rock. Q. Have you ever met Bill Clinton? MALIK MONK: I actually haven't, no.\"}, 'Donovan Mitchell': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=131260', 'text': \"Q. If you could start out with an opening statement about what you're going to bring to the Jazz. DONOVAN MITCHELL: I'm still in shock.  You know, this is a great experience.  I've been waiting for this moment for all my life.  Everybody says that, but it's one thing to say it and one thing to kind of live it, and I think that I'm just really blessed to be part of this organization.  I thank Mr. Lindsey, Coach Snyder and the Miller family for trusting me and having faith in me to bring me valuable minutes to this program, and as a playoff contender.  It's a tough decision when you have to pick for a team that is in the playoffs and develop a young guy like myself, and I'm just ready to work and put the work in, and I'm just ready for that first day of practice, that's all. Q. You mentioned going to a good team, going to a playoff team.  Is that something that you expect?  Usually when you're a top pick, you go to a bad team.  What type of adjustment is that, the fact that you may not play as many minutes early on in your career? DONOVAN MITCHELL: I'm accustomed to that, being at Louisville, highly touted program, coming in you don't play a lot of minutes as a freshman.  I just want to go in there and work and work as hard as I can and develop.  That's all you can do is work as hard as you can.  Sometimes you may not get the minutes you want, but as long as you put the effort in, everything will fall right into place, and I'm just excited to have this opportunity and this chance. Q. What was this experience like this past week, particularly tonight? DONOVAN MITCHELL: So actually I kind of had a different route than everybody.  I got in late two nights ago.  I had a workout, so I just finished my 12th or 13th workout the day before the draft.  I didn't really get to experience much of the media and all that, but this night I was fine really until Markelle got picked, and then that's when everything just kind of like switched.  And then the Jimmy Butler trade, and realizing that trades can happen so quickly and you can end up somewhere quickly.  I got picked by Denver and ended up in Utah. It's definitely an experience.  It's one of the more nerve-racking experiences of your life, but it's definitely a good type of nerve-racking experience. Q. Donovan, when in your career, whether high school or college, did you feel like this day was possible? DONOVAN MITCHELL: I would say about two months ago to be honest with you.  I didn't see myself being here.  Well, not this day, but it came faster than I expected.  Two months ago is when I really realized that I could play at this level and really compete at this level, and I think that's what really kind of has gained my confidence.  I always had confidence, but to play at this level, you need a certain type of confidence that puts you head and shoulders above other people, and I think two months is when it really kind of clicked for me.  Growing up I was a baseball player, so basketball was kind of second tier growing up, and now to be here in this arena where I've played so many times, watched so many games, now to possibly come in here and play as a road trip game is incredible, and I'm loving every minute of this.\"}, 'Lauri Markkanen': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=131257', 'text': \"Q. Please start with an opening statement about what you'll bring to your new team. LAURI MARKKANEN: Yeah, I'm just excited to get to Chicago, and I'm going to bring a lot of energy, and I can do a lot of things for the team and not just shooting the ball.  I can stretch the floor a lot and I can help the team on rebounding.  A lot of things. Q. Did you know you were going to Chicago instead of Minnesota, and what was it like when you got picked? LAURI MARKKANEN: I heard it right before the pick happened.  It wasn't really a surprise when they actually called my name, but I didn't know like too much before that. Q. And then they asked you to do the Timberwolves howl.  Was that kind of odd you were asked to do that and you're not going to play for them? LAURI MARKKANEN: Most of the questions were about Chicago.  But I'm just happy to be here and just glad to be involved in it.  Like I'm just honored if some team, organization, includes me in trades. Q. Looking at players in the NBA right now, are there any that you think specifically your game sort of is similar to or compares to, current NBA players? LAURI MARKKANEN: I know the game is changing all the time, so there's more and more big guys who can shoot the ball and stretch the floor.  But I don't think there's like one similar, one exactly like me.  I'm trying to learn from everyone and just play my own game. Q. Are there any guys' highlights you like to see to kind of see what they're doing or anything like that? LAURI MARKKANEN: Like I said, there's no just one player.  I like to watch everyone.  I try to take a little bit of everything from those guys and add them to my game. Q. Clearly the Bulls are transitioning, going in a very different direction, probably going very young.  Means a lot of minutes for you as a rookie.  Are you ready for that? LAURI MARKKANEN: Yeah, I'm definitely ready to play right away.  Whatever Coach asks me to do, I'm going to do, and I know I'm in good shape and I'm ready to play. Q. There have been a lot of talk about Jimmy Butler and how much the Bulls valued him, they didn't want to trade him unless they got back a lot in return.  To be the guy that is part of that package, how much does that say about how they feel about you and what kind of an honor is that? LAURI MARKKANEN: I mean, it's just a great honor to be here, so I'm blessed to be a part of a historic organization, so I'm just going to do everything I can to help the team win. Q. I saw you were showing a Finnish flag.  What does it mean for you as a Finn to be pick No. 7 in the NBA Draft? LAURI MARKKANEN: I mean, it's a great honor to be picked by an NBA team.  That's a big thing for me, for my country, just because it's been a little while since there's been a Finnish player on the court.  I take a lot of pride in that. Q. Chicago is obviously a very historical basketball city.  What do you kind of think about that, Michael Jordan, all the history that's what happened in Chicago?  What does that mean to you? LAURI MARKKANEN: I mean, just like I said, I'm really honored to be part of this organization, and can't wait to go there and do what I can.  It's just a blessing to be here.  And of course Michael Jordan, greatest player ever to play, so it's huge to be a part of it. Q. Is it surprising the Bulls took you?  Did you have an indication they were interested in you?  Doesn't seem like there was as much talk about them taking you as some other teams. LAURI MARKKANEN: No, I didn't have any idea that was going to happen.  I just knew that I didn't want to expect anything from that because I know there's going to be trades and so anything can happen.  But this is the first time going to Chicago, so I'm looking forward to it. Q. After a year in Arizona, how does it feel to go back whether it was Minnesota or Chicago, just to go back to weather you're kind of used to a little bit. LAURI MARKKANEN: I really don't know how is it, but I'm prepared for everything just coming all the way from Finland.  Arizona and Finland, they're quite opposite, so I think I'm going to be good.\"}, 'Mathias Lessort': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=131270', 'text': \"Q.

Please start with an opening statement about what you bring to the Pacers. TJ LEAF: Absolutely.  I'm super excited first of all.  I just want to thank the Lord.  Without Him I wouldn't be here.  Yeah, I'm super excited.  I just think my ability to stretch the floor and pass, I think will be really good complement to Myles (Turner) in the post.  And just everything they're doing there I'm super excited to get out there and start working with the team. Q. TJ, Indianapolis a little chillier in the winter than what you're used to in Southern California.  I was just curious if that crossed your mind.  Have you spent some time in cold climates? TJ LEAF: Most of family is from the Indiana area.  I spent a lot of time in the summers and whatnot.  My dad was from Indianapolis, my mom was from Evansville. Q. So this is great then. TJ LEAF: Yeah, I spent a lot of time there in the summer, so I'm really familiar with it. Q. TJ, seems the Pacers may be going in a very different direction.  Do you feel like you're a building block type player that can help? TJ LEAF: I definitely think so.  I think I'm extremely talented.  I think I'm going to come in and get to work right away.  That's the thing with me.  I'm going to work.  And I think I'm going to become a very good player.  I'm just excited to get out there and start working with all the guys and develop relationships with them, so it's going to be a lot of fun. Q. I know Larry Bird was part of some of your workouts there.  What was it like being an Indiana kid to have him around? TJ LEAF: Absolutely.  He's one of my favorite players of all time, if not my favorite.  It was great seeing him and talking with him a little bit.  Obviously he has so much knowledge of the game and he was so talented himself.  So it was great hearing from him and hearing what he has to say. Q. TJ, you mentioned Myles.  I believe he's here tonight.  Have you had a chance to talk to him? TJ LEAF: Yeah, I just had an interview with him actually.  So both really excited.  I've known Myles for a little bit, so it's just really exciting.  He's so talented, so young.  So it's going to be a lot of fun playing with him, a guy who's already got his foot in the door pretty deep for a guy who's only about to be his third year.  So I'm really excited to play with him. Q. TJ, the Pacers are coming off a disappointing season where they should have been a lot better.  What qualities do you bring that could bring the Pacers back in the right direction? TJ LEAF: Yeah, I mean, I think I bring a lot.  Just my ability to score, my ability to stretch the floor, and I'm a winner.  I'm really competitive.  I love to win, and I'm going to bring that to the team, and then just unselfishness.  I like to be unselfish, so I'm going to bring that and hopefully get the ball moving a little bit more. Q. Your old partner at Lonzo has got his shoe company, Big Baller.  Have you already settled on your sneaker deal? TJ LEAF: Haven't settled yet.  We talked about it kind of in joking, but obviously him and his family got little thing going with Triple B.  So hopefully it works out for them, but I don't know what I'm doing yet. Q. And you're one of the consumers that can actually afford the brand? TJ LEAF: I guess so.  I hope he gives me a free pair of shoes at least. Q. TJ, what aspects in your game are you looking forward to improving?  And are we going to see you back in Israel playing for the national team? TJ LEAF: Yeah, I think I need to prove in every single area.  My game has a long way to go, as all of us do.  Defensively my strength, a little bit of consistency. And I mean, as for Israel, I love it there.  I enjoyed my time tremendously when I was there, so I mean, if it works out in the future, I would love to go back. Q. Can I ask you about your suit?  It's very blue. TJ LEAF: It is. Q. Tell me who made it and how you went about choosing it. TJ LEAF: Yeah, shoutout to (indiscernible) from L of A.  We wanted to go a little bit more bold, and I think the color just complemented me really well, so he went with it and stuck with it.  I'm really happy with how it came out.  We just wanted to go a little bit more bold and not as basic as everyone. Q. Do you think it's going to stand up to draft day fashion 10 years, 20 years, that sort of thing? TJ LEAF: I don't think so.  I don't think it's that crazy.  I like Dennis's the most probably, Dennis's jacket, but I definitely like it.\"}, 'Luke Kennard': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=131245', 'text': \"Q. Talk about what you'll bring to the Pistons, please. LUKE KENNARD: First off, thank you to the Pistons for giving me this opportunity.  You know, it's a dream come true.  I'm sure guys have said that, but it really is.  I worked my entire life for a moment like this, and to be able to go to Detroit and make an impact any way I can, I'm just looking forward to it, and it's a great opportunity. Q. Luke, when you look at the Detroit Pistons, a team that's just right there in terms of being really a good playoff team, do you feel like you're the missing piece? LUKE KENNARD: Yeah, I think what I can bring to them is a big thing.  I'm a competitor.  I love to win.  Like I said, I'm just excited for it. It's close to home, being from Ohio, and I'm really, really excited, and it's going to be a fun journey with them. Q. Are you ready to be a rookie for Stan Van Gundy? LUKE KENNARD: Yeah, I am.  I think playing under him gives me a great opportunity to learn and develop as a player, so I'm really looking forward to that. Q. The Pistons have Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, who also likes to shoot the three ball.  So how exciting is it for you to move into an offense that is already fit around a player like you, and how much do you think that can help your game? LUKE KENNARD: Yeah, well, I'm going in to learn and to learn from the veterans like him and the other guys will allow me to mature as a player, and to be able to play that way, like you said, it fits me.  So I think it gives me a good opportunity to help make an impact and allow us to make that next step. Q. You've got two years in at Duke.  Are you going to finish up your education through the summers?  Is there a game plan for that? LUKE KENNARD: Yeah, I'd love to.  I think getting a degree from Duke is one of my -- it'll be a priority for me.  Any chance I'm able to go back and work towards that, I'll really look forward to. Q. Detroit is on the way up, the big three auto makers are doing well.  Is your agent going to be speaking to any of them, endorsement deals? LUKE KENNARD: Yeah, no, I'm not sure.  We'll see.  Maybe. Q. What is the most important thing you learned from Coach K, not on the court but off the court? LUKE KENNARD: Yeah, I think just to live in the moment.  This is a big moment, so I'm just enjoying it, taking it all in, and yeah, that's basically what he taught me over the years.  You know, by doing that, I have fun.  I enjoy it, and this is just a great opportunity, so I'm definitely living in the moment right now.\"}, 'Justin Jackson': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=131250', 'text': \"Q. Could you start out with an opening statement what you'll bring to your new team? JUSTIN JACKSON: Opening statement, okay.  So I guess first and foremost, I can't say enough for how thankful I am for everybody in my circle, my family, my fiancÃƒÂ©e, first and foremost, my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.  Without him, the blessings and the abilities that He's given me, I wouldn't be here. Now to move on to Sacramento.  I mean, it's an honor to be picked by them, knowing I'm going to an organization that I can get right to work.  And hopefully I'm going to bring somebody that comes to work each and every day extremely hard and does whatever he needs to do to try to be successful, so I'm really looking forward to it. Q. We talked a little bit yesterday about how you and De'Aaron know each other way back.  Now you're ending up on the same tam.  Any thoughts about being reunited with someone from your hometown and someone that you played with? JUSTIN JACKSON: Yeah, it's going to be good to at least have kind of a familiar face out there.  Sacramento is a long ways away, so to have somebody that I've been around and I know really well, that'll be great. Q. That team with him, you, Kelly Oubre, Justise Winslow, the way things are panning out, we might have to start putting you in the conversation as one of the best AAU teams ever. JUSTIN JACKSON: Yeah, I'll let y'all do that, and it is what it is.  But I was lucky to be able to play on a team like that.  We had a bunch of good players.  You know, if we go down as one of those teams, that would be great. Q. Are you excited about the youth?  Obviously De'Aaron is a guy you know, but the youth in Sacramento and obviously trying to build something special there? JUSTIN JACKSON: Yeah, I feel like it's a great situation overall.  I mean, it's a good organization.  I got to know them a little bit whenever I went out there for a workout, and it seemed like it's a group of guys that is going towards trying to be successful and guys that come in and work every single day.  Hopefully I can step right in and continue that, and we'll see where it goes. Q. Sacramento is a small town.  You guys are like the movie stars there in all likelihood.  Is this an opportunity that you're looking forward to, to be in that kind of small environment? JUSTIN JACKSON: That's a trick question right there.  You're trying to get me to already say something bad about my team. Q. It's a fine team -- JUSTIN JACKSON: I'm playing with you.  You know, I'm looking forward to it.  I mean, I grew up in a small town, so I'm looking forward to it.  It was beautiful whenever I went there, and so I'm looking forward to everything.  I'm looking forward to being there in Sacramento, getting ready for the Kings and things like that.  You know, I'm happy.  I'm happy and I'm blessed for sure. Q. A lot of young guys on this roster.  I think it's eight guys on rookie scale contracts.  Is that how you build this thing?  Is that what you're going into thinking, is that how you build this thing? JUSTIN JACKSON: I guess that's what the GM and all of them are thinking.  I mean, youth, everybody will mature and everybody is -- like I said before, everybody is trying to work extremely hard.  I'm looking forward to it, getting to know the guys a little bit more and getting in there and getting right to work. So you know, I'm looking forward to it.  Everything else, whatever happens happens, but I'm really looking forward to it. Q. Hasn't been a lot of wins in Sacramento.  You're used to winning.  How are you going to deal with that? JUSTIN JACKSON: I'm going to work extremely hard to try to bring more wins.  I mean, at the end of the day, whatever the situation that I'm in or any of these guys are in, we've got to deal with it.  So for me, I'm going to work my hardest to try to make that situation better as much as I can, and I know everybody else in the organization is.  You know, it'll definitely be a group effort, and we're definitely going to try to change things. Q. Following up on that question, how much do you look forward to that challenge of giving that team an identity and turning it into a winner? JUSTIN JACKSON: Man, that's a great challenge to have.  For me I've always loved whenever somebody says you can't necessarily do something or whatever.  So for me I'm going to go in there, like I said before, work extremely hard.  That's the whole mindset.  We're going to try to change things and be extremely competitive and try to win as many games as we can.  So we'll see how everything falls. Q. As a Christian man, when is a point in your life when your faith was most important to you? JUSTIN JACKSON: That's every day.  I mean, there's never been a day when it hasn't been important.  He's the reason that I'm here in this position.  He's the reason that I have the ability to play basketball.  And so there's never been a day when He's been less or more important.  He's always extremely important to me. Q. You played for three years under one of the greatest college coaches in history, Roy Williams.  What is the greatest basketball lesson you've learned from him in those three years? JUSTIN JACKSON: Coach always is prepared for whatever might come, and so I think that's been the biggest thing for me is always trying to be prepared as much as you possibly can.  So whether it's going into a game, being prepared for your opponent, being prepared for the guy that you might guard or who might be guarding you or whatever it might be, just trying to be prepared.  And he was always great at doing it for basketball and life in general.  And so translating that into my life, it's helped a lot.  So for that, I can't thank him enough. Q. I just realized you and De'Aaron Fox really have your work cut out for you for another reason:  The Golden State Warriors are only 90 miles west of where you play.  It's going to be tough to win that fanbase back again.  Have you thought of that when they called your name, that those Warriors aren't far away from you? JUSTIN JACKSON: I'll be honest with you, I didn't really think about the Warriors much at all.  All I've been thinking about is the fact that one of my dreams has really come true and I'm going to an organization that I'm extremely happy to join, and I can't wait to get started with them. Q. Sacramento is pretty far away from where you're from.  Do you plan on bringing some of your boys or family members out there to live with you? JUSTIN JACKSON: I'm going to bring my fiancÃƒÂ©e once we get married, so she'll be the one that will be out there with me, and we'll kind of start on this journey together.\"}, 'Josh Jackson': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=131244', 'text': \"Q. Josh, your mother played college basketball at the University of Texas El Paso.  Is there anything lesson you learned from basketball from your mother that you'll take to the NBA? JOSH JACKSON: Well, you know, my mom has taught me so much, on and off the court.  She's taught me a few moves that I still use to this day and just being such a competitor, I think I really got my competitive spirit from her.  She was in college, high school, middle school playing, she was the exact same way.  She hated to lose.  And I think that's the most special thing about me.  I get it from her. Q. And what quality of your game makes you, in your opinion, the best player in this draft? JOSH JACKSON: I think my versatility, just my competitive spirit.  I don't think the other guys in this draft really care as much as I do.  I don't think they play as hard as I do, period.  I think that's what really makes me special.  I refuse to fail, period. Q. Josh, through this process, it seemed like the Suns had locked in on you and you guys had locked in on the Suns.  What was it about the Suns' situation that made you comfortable to maybe not work out with some other teams? JOSH JACKSON: Well, the only team I didn't work out for at the top of the draft was the Celtics, and that was due to scheduling.  I was excited to be on any team at the top of the draft to be honest, whether it was Philly, Boston, LA.  I felt like the type of player that I am, I could fit anywhere.  But when I look at Phoenix and I see that they are so young and kind of need a 3, somebody to come in and play that 3 spot, and I feel like that's my favorite position to play.  That's where I'm the most comfortable.  I automatically just get excited when I see stuff like that. Q. You said your mom played in El Paso, kind of a similar climate to Phoenix.  Did mom tell you the importance of staying hydrated?  (Laughter). JOSH JACKSON: Yeah, she has told me the importance of staying hydrated.  She tries to get me to drink a lot of water, more than I think I should, to be honest. Q. Unfortunately one of the occupation at hazards out there is kidney stones and others, so you really do have to stay hydrated. JOSH JACKSON: Yeah, I'm going to keep that in mind.  I'm going to try to stay away from the kidney stones. Q. Watching you on the recruiting trail over the years, talking with Bill (Self) about your competitive spirit.  I was wondering if you feel more gratitude for being selected or perhaps a competitive edge that you weren't picked higher because there were plenty of talent evaluators that rated you as the best prospect in this class. JOSH JACKSON: Well, yeah, I feel a little bit of both sides of what you said.  If you ask me, of course I'm going to say I'm the best player in this draft, but if you ask those other guys, they're going to say the same thing about themselves, I'm sure.  But just I love competition, and I love proving people wrong.  I've been drafted to Phoenix, and I'm going to go there and I'm going to make the best of it.  I'm going to be the best player I can be.  And those teams who didn't draft me, one day they will be sorry. Q. For those that might follow college basketball, casually obviously I know you've spoken on this many times, but just here on draft night, some clarification if there might be any character concerns considering the issue that you had off the court at Kansas, if you can kind of speak to that and why that might not necessarily represent who you are as a person off the floor. JOSH JACKSON: I don't think it really represents who I am.  You know, I made a mistake that day.  I did.  I admitted to it from day one when it was brought up.  I think the whole situation was really blown out of proportion, just because I am who I am.  Reporters want to make a story and get themselves a name.  But everyone who was close to the situation and everyone who I've talked to about it, they know exactly what happened that day.  There was nothing that -- it wasn't what it was made out to be.  It wasn't as bad as everybody made it out to be.  But I have owned up to the mistake I made and I accept the responsibility for it from day one. Q. Now that you're officially in the NBA, is there anybody on your list that you're just dying to play against? JOSH JACKSON: Well, Draymond Green, of course.  I've been knowing him for a long time now.  And I've watched him grow since he was in high school and playing at Michigan State.  He's kind of exactly how I am in terms of being competitive and a little bit of trash talking, so I'm really excited to get out there and be able to play against him.  Obviously there are a lot of great players in this league, LeBron James, one of the best players in the world, Kevin Durant.  I really want to get out there and see where I stack up against some of the best players in the world. Q. I saw that you had Coach Self at your table tonight.  Can you speak on what he's meant to you in this past year kind of having him in your life? JOSH JACKSON: Well, through the recruiting process, Coach Self has always been amazing.  My time at Kansas, he made amazing for me.  Before I even decided to go to Kansas, I always felt that he cared about me more than a basketball player.  He cared about me as a man.  He wanted me to be the best man that I could be.  That was one of the biggest reasons I chose to go to Kansas.  It speaks to his character today, coming out and being able to support me and just being here for me.  It shows that he really cares. Q. Did he have any message for you after you were selected or anything like that? JOSH JACKSON: I haven't talked to him since I've been selected, but I'm sure I will.\"}, 'Frank Jackson': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=131259', 'text': \"Q. Could you start off with an opening statement about your game and what you'll bring, please? FRANK JACKSON: Sure.  I'm super excited to be in this situation.  You know, to be a part of New Orleans and the organization means the world to me.  I'm part of the NBA.  People can expect me to be a fierce competitor and someone who can lead a team and get out and defend.  Just play my game.  I'm just super excited to be here and grateful for this opportunity. Q. Frank, talk about playing with two big centers like Anthony Davis and Boogie Cousins.  What's that going to be like for you? FRANK JACKSON: I mean, those are two of the best bigs in the league.  It's going to teach me a lot.  It's going to allow me to play with those guys and just learn.  I'm looking forward to it. Q. What did you have talking with Coach K getting ready for this process?  I'm sure he's helped all of you guys, but what did he say to you in this process and how he helped you off the court? FRANK JACKSON: He's been tremendous from day one, and he's really had my back and has really supported me throughout this whole deal and tends to give me his words of wisdom.  But for the most part, just to be there and to know that he cares for me and wants the best for me. Q. Loving the suit; you get best dressed of the night. FRANK JACKSON: That means a lot, thank you. Q. Can you tell me about the short pants and the color and everything?  How did you go about -- FRANK JACKSON: Yeah, so it's from Ella Vive (phonetic), Shandra, she's great.  Sat down with her and picked out what I wanted to do.  She gave me a few options.  Fell in love with this.  I don't know, I just think this fits me well, and you only get one of these, so it's pretty cool. Q. Do you wear a lot of like short pants? FRANK JACKSON: I do, even like my jeans and even my sweats and stuff, I love them kind of like -- not high water, that's what my dad calls them, but that's my style and I like that. Q. Did you know you were going to be going to New Orleans the whole time? FRANK JACKSON: No, I didn't.  Just minutes before the Hornets picked, I found out, and I'm so grateful.  But they weren't in my mind to be honest.\"}, 'Wesley Iwundu': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=131267', 'text': \"Q. Please start off with an opening statement about what you'll bring to your new team. WESLEY IWUNDU: Oh, man, you know, just going to bring a lot of intensity on defense, doing all the little things to win, anything I can to help out the team in a good way, in a positive way.  I'm going to bring that to the table.\"}, 'Jonathan Isaac': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=131242', 'text': \"Q. Jonathan, you're familiar with the region.  How nice is it to come back to Florida and be in a situation with Orlando and be the first draft pick of this new front office that's had a big track record of success? JONATHAN ISAAC: Yeah, it feels great.  I know about their track record, and I know they know about turning teams around, and I feel blessed that they thought that I could be a part of that. Q. You were the first player to be drafted from a state that doesn't have any income tax.  Did your agent give you a high five on that and did any other players express some envy about this? JONATHAN ISAAC: Honestly I thought about that before, but I haven't thought about that tonight, so thank you for putting that back in my head.  It feels great. Q. What do you make of this Orlando core, a lot of young players there, are you excited to play alongside them?  And what's your first impression of the team? JONATHAN ISAAC: My first impression is that we're young and we just got younger.  There's a lot of room for growth, and there's a lot of things to do to grow.  Just getting in and seeing what I can do, seeing that I can be the hard worker that comes in and doesn't have an agenda, is humble and can just do whatever he has to do. Q. John Hammond has had success with guys with a lot of length, Giannis, Thon Maker.  How excited are you to pick his brain a little bit and go somewhere where they're used to length and wingspan? JONATHAN ISAAC: It feels great.  I feel like I'm coming home to somebody who knows who I am and what I'm capable of and where I can be in the future.  I think that's huge because my progression is going to be different than a lot of other players, and I know I have a lot of untapped potential, and I feel like I went to the perfect team to untap it. Q. Speaking of coming home, to come back home to New York City, to be drafted after spending the first 10 years of your life in the Bronx, sentimental for you tonight?  How do you feel about that? JONATHAN ISAAC: It feels great.  It is sentimental.  It honestly seems like the perfect story, coming home to get drafted to go back to where you were.  It definitely feels like it's a story written before I was born. Q. Jonathan, you recently had a growth spurt where you grew six inches.  Do you think that growth spurt has really helped you in spite of your size right now to maintain your guard skills? JONATHAN ISAAC: Yeah, it's definitely helped me.  It's made it harder to maintain my guard skills because I was shorter back then, but it's opened other doors, like being able to be a versatile defender and block shots, move my feet, stuff like that.\"}, 'Isaiah Hartenstein': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=131261', 'text': \"Q. Could you start out with an opening statement what you'll bring to your new team, please? ISAIAH HARTENSTEIN: Just a lot of versatility.  I mean, I think especially with my height, seven-foot, I can really put the ball on the ground, play the post, and what I really didn't show this year but I really can do and I kind of proved in most of the workouts, that I can really shoot, and I think especially with Houston, bringing -- laying the floor out, I can really help in that, and just rebounding and doing all those things on the court. Q. Can you tell how big is that for you?  You're such a young guy, making the step to Lithuania was an interesting step.  Some people said, ooh, difficult, and now you made it.  How proud are you now? ISAIAH HARTENSTEIN: I mean, definitely just being in different situations in my life, coming from Eugene to Germany then to Lithuania really helped me mature as a player and as a person, and I think I was really ready for this step, and I think now just getting picked where I got picked, I think now I'm just coming in with another chip on my shoulder, and I think I'm just going to work as hard as I can and just -- yeah. Q. One more question concerning your family:  Also your father who I guess was a very important person for you.  Can you tell me about them, how important are they for you, for your career? ISAIAH HARTENSTEIN: Very important.  I mean, me being around my dad really helped me a lot just being -- I mean, I've been around professionals since I was 11, practicing already when I was 15.  Me coming in, I know the professional lifestyle, I know what everything costs on and off the cost.  Just being a professional, I think I can really bring that to the team. Q. Obviously getting to the NBA was a major goal that you followed throughout your life.  Now that you've accomplished that goal here in the league, do you have any goals going forward for your rookie year and just your career as a whole in the league? ISAIAH HARTENSTEIN: I mean, in my career I just want to be a winner.  That's just -- just being a champion at the end of my career, that people know I'm a champion.  That's probably the biggest thing.  And rookie year is proving that I'm better than where I got picked at, and again, having a chip on my shoulder.  I think even being picked, it's a good situation. Houston is a really good organization.  Being picked by them is -- first of all, just want to thank them for picking me, and just going into it with a chip on my shoulder and just going to try to work harder and harder. Q. Do you know a lot about the Rockets organization going in?  Do you have any background knowledge about the team and the franchise and the players? ISAIAH HARTENSTEIN: Definitely.  James Harden is a big piece of them and they have a lot of shooters around him, and I think definitely I can also bring some shooting to the team, just helping James Harden out and being a good rebounder.  First of all, I'm just blessed to be a part of this organization, and I'm just going to work my hardest. Q. Did you already talk with the other German NBA guys, with Dirk, with Dennis or Paul Zipser? ISAIAH HARTENSTEIN: I was in Chicago, had a workout with them, and so I talked a little bit with Paul, but not much.  But in general that's probably the only guy I talked to before going into the draft.\"}, 'Markelle Fultz': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=131241', 'text': 'Q. It seems like you not only work hard but you can see the emotion in your eyes.  Just talk about the whole step, the whole process, and what are you really feeling right now? MARKELLE FULTZ: Right now it\\'s unbelievable really.  I mean, say you want to do something, and to go out and do it is unbelievable.  Right now I\\'m very excited for myself and my family.  I get a chance to take care of my family and I get to do something a lot of kids want to do.  So I\\'m just very happy, and like I say, I\\'m blessed. Q. Did you always know you would make it to the NBA, or when did you realize you would have a shot at this? MARKELLE FULTZ: Yeah, I didn\\'t know I was going to make it here.  I mean, it was a goal when I was younger, and I just love the game of basketball, so I played it every day, just for fun, and it was something I loved to do.  And I really figured out I had a chance to make it there probably my 11th grade.  11th grade, going into my 11th grade here, and I just realized that I was doing stuff that other kids weren\\'t doing, and it just started to work out for me, so I just kept working hard. Q. What\\'s your main quality and what\\'s your flaw? MARKELLE FULTZ: I think my main quality is just my personality on and off the court, the way I am as a person.  And the flaw, I mean, people might say I don\\'t talk a lot really, so I think that\\'s the flaw. Q. You seem like you have a pretty good relationship with Ben Simmons and Joel Embiid.  What is your relationship like with them? MARKELLE FULTZ: Yeah, Ben Simmons, of course he went to Montverde, so going there I kind of knew about him and followed him on Twitter, Instagram, and then we ended up exchanging numbers.  And I\\'ve been texting him through the college process, and just getting advice through college and just wishing him good luck. And of course Embiid everyone knows him from Twitter and how funny he is and how good of a person he is.  In the last couple weeks and stuff I started talking to him a lot more.  He used to tweet and retweet my stuff.  Like I said, once he figured out I had a chance to go there, he started showing more love and everything like that. Q. When you went to Philadelphia or Camden last week, what was that like?  And did you have a feeling at that point that was going to be the spot for you? MARKELLE FULTZ: So that morning I woke up, I didn\\'t know where I was going.  I didn\\'t know where I was working out for.  My trainer Keith (Williams) just told me, \"We\\'ve got to go to Philly.\"  Okay, I play basketball, I love it.  I just got in the car and went to sleep the whole way up.  It\\'s not that far, so we drove down there, worked out.  And after I worked out, I felt confident in my workout.  And just seeing the players there and everybody there happy, and them talking to me after the workout, just telling me they liked what I did and everything like that and trying to work out something, I just feel happy for myself.  Like I said, all I needed is an opportunity, and I got the opportunity, so I was satisfied. Q. Obviously it\\'s sort of a whirlwind for you right now.  Have you been able to have any conversations yet with Bryan Colangelo or Brett Brown, what they\\'re expecting from you as you come into the organization? MARKELLE FULTZ: We\\'ve just talked about just how glad they are for me really, not really the expectations but I\\'m pretty sure I\\'m going to talk to them soon about everything like that.  They\\'re pretty much just happy for me.  This is a once-in-a-lifetime thing, and that\\'s pretty much what they were indicating to me, just have fun with this process no matter where I go, and I\\'m happy that I came here. Q. A lot of people don\\'t know about you that if you stayed in school you wanted to study accounting.  I understand Josh Harris, the owner of the 76ers is a Wharton University of Pennsylvania alum.  Are you going to ask if he can set it up to take some courses in the off-season? MARKELLE FULTZ: Definitely.  That\\'s one thing I\\'m looking into, I invest my money and know what\\'s going on with it.  I want to use all the resources I can. Q. Is that what drew you to accounting, the interest in it because of personal investing? MARKELLE FULTZ: Yeah, definitely, and you make a lot of money doing it, so of course. Q. This is kind of a point guard draft; how much pride do you take knowing that you and a bunch of other point guards are going very high in this draft? MARKELLE FULTZ: I take a lot of pride in it.  First of all, just being the competitive nature I have, I\\'m very competitive, and then just competing against all these guards.  I know how talented they are and how talented this draft class.  I think this point guard class is pretty strong. Q. You\\'ve proven skeptics wrong throughout your high school and college career.  Do you feel motivation to prove Boston wrong to trading the No. 1 pick? MARKELLE FULTZ: I don\\'t have anything against Boston, so I don\\'t feel like that.  I feel like everything I do is not to prove anybody wrong, it\\'s to prove myself and do stuff that I set goals for myself, so that\\'s what I\\'m looking forward to. Q. You have a very Michael Jordan-like story where you were a 5\\'9\" sophomore, you tried out for your varsity team and you didn\\'t make it.  At that point did you ever doubt that you would be here tonight? MARKELLE FULTZ: Never.  My confidence and my goals never changed no matter what.  It just made me realize that it\\'s a milestone that I have to get over, a hill I have to get over, and I just started working even harder.  There\\'s going to be bumps in the road, but that doesn\\'t mean you\\'ve got to change your goal. Q. What aspect of the game makes you the best player in this draft? MARKELLE FULTZ: I think how versatile I am.  I mean, I don\\'t think it\\'s one thing I can\\'t do.  I think I do everything at least decent, and that\\'s what I think. Q. Talking about your versatility, did they talk to you about playing off the ball, like you would slide to the two guard, Ben Simmons would be the point, or did they say you\\'re going to be the point and he\\'s going to move off? MARKELLE FULTZ: Really it\\'s just do whatever you need to do to win.  It\\'s going to be times where maybe Ben brings up the ball or times where I\\'m bringing up the ball.  It\\'s going to do whatever we need to do to win. Q. You talked about this was always your dream, but was it your dream to be first? MARKELLE FULTZ: Yeah, that was my goal.  That was my goal.  In high school I told my trainer Keith I wanted to be the No. 1 player in the country and the No. 1 draft pick, so it was a goal I set out there, and that\\'s what I was striving for. Q. There\\'s so much energy in Philadelphia surrounding NBA basketball, the return of the Sixers, a great nucleus there.  Talk about the excitement of being one of the centerpieces of the revitalization of the Sixers, a team that is so steeped in basketball tradition. MARKELLE FULTZ: It\\'s, like I said, a great opportunity, and I\\'m very excited really, just the fans in Philly, how they back up their players and everything like that, and I\\'m just looking forward to going in there and giving it my all and hopefully changing the program around.'}, \"De'Aaron Fox\": {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=131243', 'text': 'Q. What were the lead-up moments like for you sitting there with your family?  I saw Coach Cal was here but it seemed to drag on for a while, waiting for names to be picked.  What was that like? De\\'AARON FOX: It did feel extremely long.  We were talking about that.  But we were just talking about how much of a blessing it is to just be here.  Not a lot of kids at 19 years old get to sit in the Green Room at the NBA Draft.  But just being up here now, emotions kind of change a little bit.  You\\'re sitting there anxious waiting to hear your name called, and once it\\'s called, it\\'s like the world lifted off your shoulders, like there\\'s zero gravity.  I feel like I\\'m flying out. Q. When did you know?  At what point did you know you were being selected fifth? De\\'AARON FOX: After Phoenix picked.  Just shortly after that. Q. When did you know to ask for the visor? De\\'AARON FOX: Actually I asked for a visor with every team, and Sacramento heard it, and they blessed me by giving me a visor.  It looks good, doesn\\'t it? Q. De\\'Aaron, I think you had said before the draft you thought you were the best point guard in this draft.  Two points taken ahead of you.  Is that any kind of motivation for you? De\\'AARON FOX: Well, like I always said, it doesn\\'t matter what order we get picked in, the motivation is already there.  We\\'re all going to the NBA.  There\\'s motivation every game.  You\\'re always playing a great point guard.  But is it more motivation?  Not really.  You\\'re just going in and playing basketball. Q. What\\'s it mean, three point guards among the top five picks to be part of what\\'s going to be known as a point guard draft? De\\'AARON FOX: I mean, it\\'s extremely gratifying for me to be in that top five, and we already knew that this was going to be a pretty tough draft and it was pretty loaded at the point guard position, and for me to be up there is just a blessing. Q. De\\'Aaron, you mentioned the other point guards.  With Fultz going No. 1, Ball, they got a lot of attention during the pre-draft process, does that motivate you, the fact that you were third and those guys were getting so much hype? De\\'AARON FOX: No, it doesn\\'t motivate me any more.  I want to say probably with Lonzo being No. 2 to LA and me being here, it gave a lot of people what they wanted.  We\\'ll have to play each other four times in a year.  But like I said, it doesn\\'t give me any more motivation.  Every night you\\'ve got to bring your \"A\" game in the NBA, especially playing the point guard position. Q. How well do you know Willie Cauley-Stein and Skal Labissiere, and what factor do you think that might be to other Kentucky guys? De\\'AARON FOX: Well, I\\'ve known Skal for a few years.  Willie I see him every once in a while really just through Kentucky, but Skal I\\'ve known when we were in high school.  They could have given good words.  I know how they play.  I was playing with two bigs that could catch a lob anywhere, and as good as Skal is, and you keep seeing both of them getting better, I thought it was a good fit. Q. Sacramento has the tenth pick, too.  How strongly would you encourage them to make Malik (Monk)? De\\'AARON FOX: If they take him, I\\'d be happy playing with Malik again.  But I think they\\'re actually about to pick now. Q. Harder question:  Sacramento has really struggled to find any direction.  Are you going to be the guy that gives this Kings team direction? De\\'AARON FOX: For me going into the NBA, I know it\\'s going to be tough to change a team, but for me I wanted to come in and be able to affect the game right away.  A lot of people say I could be a franchise changer, and that\\'s what I really want to be. Q. Sacramento has not made the Playoffs since 2006.  They were once a proud franchise about 13 years ago.  What intangible qualities do you have that could at least lead Sacramento in the right direction next season? De\\'AARON FOX: Just the leadership.  Sometimes when a team is not doing too well, they probably didn\\'t have the leadership that they wanted.  Especially playing the point guard position, usually that\\'s the leader on the team, and I know I\\'m going to come in, the youngest guy on the team, but just try to earn everybody\\'s respect.  I have a few friends that are actually on the team already, so that\\'ll pretty much help me. But just going in there and just being able to lead, they\\'re in a tough division, a tough conference, but everybody has their jobs, but I just want to come in and be ready to turn it around. Q. You are going on to a rebuilding team.  Will it be frustrating for you not to be winning games in the first year, where you have to adjust from being on a great winning program like Kentucky in college? De\\'AARON FOX: It\\'ll be different, but a lot of people are going through it.  A lot of people are going to a team like this and change it around and became championship teams.  So that\\'s just one thing I want to do.  I know it\\'ll take a few years.  Nothing changes overnight.  But for me it will be different.  They asked me about that.  But we\\'re just trying to steer this franchise in the right direction.  Great question. Q. Now that you\\'re in the NBA, you\\'re in a pack with such talented guards.  How do you separate yourself? De\\'AARON FOX: It\\'s tough.  It\\'s difficult.  But for me, I feel like defensively I\\'m going to try to do that.  But going into the league like this where the point guard position is the toughest position to play night in and night out, you\\'ve just got to go at people because like I said, it\\'s the toughest position, but they\\'re going to come at you every single night.  It\\'s just trying to remain consistent over the entire year. Q. You have a megawatt smile, you\\'re very articulate.  The other two point guards are going into markets where the endorsements come a lot easier.  Sacramento is not really known for Fortune 500 headquarters.  I was curious if that\\'s a frustration for you and is that something you and your agent spoke about? De\\'AARON FOX: You know, the market didn\\'t matter for me.  It didn\\'t matter what team picked me.  I felt like going to Sacramento I already had a good vibe there.  The fans love their basketball, they wanted me, and I felt like going in and already knowing the players, I felt like it would make that transition extremely smooth. Q. Who are you most looking forward to playing against in the NBA, especially point guard-wise?  I know you\\'re good friends with John Wall.  Talk about some other players. De\\'AARON FOX: Like I said before, the point guard position is tough, and it\\'s hard to really just single out one person because I could have Russell one night, Kyrie one night, then have a night off and have Chris Paul and John Wall and Steph.  But for me, Russell is my favorite -- has been my favorite player the last year, so I would say Russell. Q. Do you think it\\'s your defense that sets you apart from the other two point guards taken early in the draft? De\\'AARON FOX: I feel like it is that, and speed is something you really can\\'t teach.  But defensively I feel like I really separated myself because I go at people not only offensively trying to score and get my teammates involved, but defensively I\\'ve always been trying to lock someone up, and in this league it is going to be extremely tough.  In this league you can\\'t really lock up a point guard by yourself; it\\'s more of a team effort. Q. What\\'s the most important thing that you\\'ve learned from Coach Cal not on the court but off the court? De\\'AARON FOX: It\\'s just fight.  You\\'ve got to fight for whatever you want.  That\\'s on the court and off the court.  Nothing is going to be given to you.  We had the bright light on us in Lexington, and going into the NBA nothing is going to change.  It\\'s just going to get brighter.'}, 'Jawun Evans': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=131265', 'text': \"Q. Talk about what you're going to bring to your team. JAWUN EVANS: I'm going to bring to my team a hard worker, somebody who wants to get better.  I'm looking forward to playing with the Clippers behind Chris Paul, someone I've modeled my game after, so I'm going to learn a lot from him and just take it day by day and just work hard.\"}, 'Damyean Dotson': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=131269', 'text': 'Q. Please start out with an opening statement about what you\\'ll bring to your new team. DAMYEAN DOTSON: Man, this is a dream come true for me, but I bring a versatility, great attitude and effort, probably the best teammate the Knicks -- probably the best player and the best teammate that anybody on the Knicks ever had. Q. What will it mean for you to play at Madison Square Garden? DAMYEAN DOTSON: It will mean a lot.  I\\'m very excited.  I remember coming to \"Rumble in the Bronx\", the tournament, and passing MSG and they was rebuilding it, not rebuilding but doing some construction around it, but it was a great experience.  And I\\'m ready to get in there and get some shots up, do anything, kiss the ground, whatever I need to do. Q. Your college career kind of had some peaks and valleys.  Can you just reflect on, you went through the incident at Oregon and now here you are drafted by the Knicks.  Have you kind of reflected on what you\\'ve been through? DAMYEAN DOTSON: Oh, man, I do that every day.  Just my whole journey coming from Oregon, I was there two years, had a pretty good two seasons, transferred to the University of Houston for two years, played there for Kelvin Sampson.  It\\'s been a great journey for me, just my hard work I put in and just staying true to myself and believing in myself, and to get here today is a blessing. Q. When you were going through the thing at Oregon, did you think that was going to end your career? DAMYEAN DOTSON: I tried to stay positive.  I didn\\'t know what was going to happen, and I was just hoping for the best. Q. What did the setbacks in your career teach you? DAMYEAN DOTSON: Just to stay focused, learn from it, a maturity.  Just everything that guys don\\'t get to experience right away, I got that experience early at 20 years old.  Just my maturity and just having the chance to play again and just working hard.  It made me work even harder.  It made me hungrier.'}, 'John Collins': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=131254', 'text': \"Q. John, could you start out with an opening statement, what you'll bring to the Hawks, please? JOHN COLLINS: First off, I want to say I'm blessed.  Happy to be a Hawk.  Shows a lot of promise that the organization is willing to take the time to pick me.  Like I said, happy to be a Hawk, and ready to give my all for the organization, so go Hawks! Q. John, the Atlanta Hawks just traded away Dwight Howard, made some changes in the front office, clearly a team that's trying to do some things differently.  How do you feel like you fit and what do you feel like you're going to bring to the team? JOHN COLLINS: Obviously the organization has a winning culture of being able to make the playoffs consistently for a number of years now, with the front office changes, something is going in the right direction.  They're a team that constantly wants to improve and going forward, so as a young guy I want to come in there and learn that winning culture and just bring that to the team. Q. I assume you enjoyed your time in Winston-Salem and now you get to stay in the Southeast.  Now that this is done, were you kind of hoping to stay in the Southeast because you chose to go to college there? JOHN COLLINS: Wherever I went is wherever I went but obviously now that this happened, it's always cool to stay in sort of the same area as Wake, and obviously mom down the road in South Florida.  So definitely cool staying in town. Q. I assume Delta Airlines will be getting a lot of business. JOHN COLLINS: Yeah, definitely.  Mom is a big Delta fan anyway, so she'll be in and out of Atlanta a lot.\"}, 'Zach Collins': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=131247', 'text': \"Q. Could you start out with an opening statement, what you'll bring to Portland? ZACH COLLINS: I'm just real excited, man.  My dream just came true.  I'm just going to go to Portland, give them everything I've got and help them win some games. Q. There was that trade confusion before the draft; were you confused, or were you alerted to the situation and did you know it was going to happen? ZACH COLLINS: I kind of knew it was going to happen.  Me and my agent were talking at the table before they said my name, and he told me that Sacramento was going to take the pick, and then Portland was going to trade for it and get me.  I kind of just found out a little bit before.  But it still didn't matter.  When he said my name and I walked up on that stage, it was nothing like I've ever experienced. Q. You're going to Portland, which is known for their guards.  What else do you think you can bring to add depth to that team at the 4 position? ZACH COLLINS: I think I can bring my shooting ability.  I think I can stretch the floor, and I think in today's game shooting the 3, regardless of position, is really important.  I think I can bring some toughness, some shot-blocking, rebounding, and I just think I can bring a winning mentality. Q. Yesterday you talked about wouldn't it be fun to stay in the Northwest, and here it is, it happened.  Talk about that. ZACH COLLINS: Yeah, I mean, you never know when -- I mean, you guys watch the draft all the time, it's so unpredictable.  And to be able to get your name called up and you realize that you're honestly going maybe like a two-hour or hour-and-a-half flight away from where you grew up your whole life, it's just another comfort level you have going into a new experience. Q. Do you feel like when a team trades for you that there's more that you have to be for them as a player? ZACH COLLINS: No, I feel like I'm my toughest critic and I expect more of myself than anyone, and regardless if they traded me or not, my mindset wouldn't change. Q. How familiar are you with what the Trail Blazers do particularly from an offensive perspective, and how do you think you might fit in? ZACH COLLINS: I'm not too familiar with the way they play.  I haven't really studied their sets or anything like that.  But I know they're tough.  That Western conference is a tough conference.  It's loaded with talent.  But I just know they're a tough team and they don't back down from anybody, and obviously like you said they've got Dame and C.J. and those bigs over there right now, they're pretty well balanced, and I think I can add to that. Q. Portland is probably one of the hipper markets to play in.  We have a guy from Queens that plays there, Moe Harkless -- ZACH COLLINS: Sounds familiar, yeah. Q. Anyway, you'll get to know him when you're out there. ZACH COLLINS: Yeah, for sure. Q. In general from a defensive perspective, that's been one of the areas of emphasis for the Trail Blazers the past couple years.  How do you feel like from an NBA defensive perspective you might be able to fit, and not necessarily maybe with the Blazers but just in general with your skills? ZACH COLLINS: I just think I can bring my shot-blocking that I did a pretty good job of that in college.  I think I can bring that to the NBA.  The NBA game is different, but timing and all that stuff, I think it comes natural to shot blockers, and I think I have that.  I think I'm going to bring that.  I think I'm going to bring a lot of defensive rebounding, boxing out, fighting for rebounds, and I think that toughness under the rim is something I'm going to bring.\"}, 'Thomas Bryant': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=131264', 'text': \"Q. Can you start out with an opening statement about what you're going to bring to your new team, please. THOMAS BRYANT: I feel what I'm going to bring to any organization is my passion for the game, you know, the love that I have, the passion for the game, the ability to talk out there on the offensive and defensive end, and the versatility that I bring on the offensive end, as well, and continue to gain the more versatility that I can on the defensive end, as well. Q. What do you know about your team, players, Coach, management?  What do you know about your new team? THOMAS BRYANT: I know a lot about them.  I watched them throughout the playoffs.  I remember going to the games the last playoff series when they played against the Clippers, Gobert and Gordon Hayward, they've got Iso Joe also over there, so I feel like it'll be a great fit.\"}, 'Jonah Bolden': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=131262', 'text': 'Q. Could you start out with an opening statement about what you\\'re going to bring to your new team, please. JONAH BOLDEN: Personally I think I\\'ll bring my length, my ability to get the rebound, push the floor and create for my teammates.  I think that\\'s a great fit for what Philadelphia and my teammates are trying to do for the future.  With Ben being able to create off the rebound, Markelle brings it up and creates.  We\\'ve just got a long team, and I feel like I\\'ll fit well. Q. Obviously your experience at UCLA didn\\'t really go as you imagined it.  A lot of people thought you were going to declare for the draft instead of going overseas.  What led to you doing that? JONAH BOLDEN: At the time I just felt like I wasn\\'t ready, wasn\\'t satisfied with myself.  I knew I could do more to prepare myself best for the league, for where I\\'m at right now.  And I just felt I needed to work on a little more things, work on a lot more of my weaknesses, and I did so in 12 months. Q. What was your experience like playing over in Serbia? JONAH BOLDEN: Yeah, for me personally, it was the best 12 months of my basketball career in the sense that I matured as a man, and like I said, I focused a lot on my weaknesses and improving them.  Yeah, we went through three coaches.  I take the positives out of that in the sense that they all had different approaches, they all had different systems, and I had to adapt to each and every one of them. Overall it was a great experience.  My teammates from back there are my brothers now, and I\\'m thankful for it. Q. Was that a tough environment to play in?  A foreign country, very cold environment, crazy fans out there, was that difficult to get adjusted to that? JONAH BOLDEN: Not really.  It wasn\\'t really a culture shock for me.  I played internationally with the Australian team and in the Czech Republic, Lithuania.  I\\'m from Australia, so the culture shock wasn\\'t a big thing.  Language barrier for the most part wasn\\'t that difficult.  All my teammates and coaches spoke pretty good English.  So really just adapting to the new game.  Style of play in Europe was my biggest thing. Q. Your dad played 17 years overseas.  What has he taught you about becoming professional and staying in the NBA and having a successful career? JONAH BOLDEN: Yeah, he\\'s been my No. 1 influence off the court and on the court.  He did play professionally 17 years, and tells me, Carry yourself as a professional.  He said that from day one, treat others the way you want to be treated.  On the court work your butt off.  Buy into the system.  Any coach or any team you\\'re playing for, just buy in.  The ball will come, the shots will come, just buy in, play defense and work hard. Q. I understand you just signed a two-year deal with Red Star Belgrade.  Do you know what your situation is going to be this year? JONAH BOLDEN: My plan is to play in the NBA next year. Q. I know you said you\\'re maybe a 3, maybe a 4.  What do you see your role being in the NBA?  Can you play both positions? JONAH BOLDEN: Yeah, yeah, I believe I\\'m a versatile forward.  To me 3 and 4 nowadays in the NBA is kind of a mix between the two, and I feel I can play 3 or 4, both offensively and defensively. Q. With your contract, is there a buyout provision?  Can you get out of it? JONAH BOLDEN: Yes, sir, I can get out of it, yes, sir. Q. How about Ben Simmons?  What kind of relationship do you guys have? JONAH BOLDEN: As of recently I haven\\'t spoken to Ben.  He reached out within the past couple months.  I spoke to him when I was in Australia.  We had a pretty good relationship, then we came over here and played high school together.  When I went to UCLA and he went to LSU we didn\\'t speak as much.  I\\'m sure we\\'ll speak a lot more.  We have a lot of stuff in common. Q. Had you had much contact with the 76ers before the draft? JONAH BOLDEN: They were in the debate.  A lot of teams had shown interest.  They were one of them. Q. In addition to Ben Simmons, how much do you know about the Sixers as they\\'re currently constructed?  How much do you know about the franchise and the organization and that crop of players that\\'s currently constructed? JONAH BOLDEN: Just from watching the past 12 months, the past 12 months is probably the most NBA I\\'ve watched.  I bought League Pass the third day I was in Serbia, and I watched in the beginning in the hopes of watching Ben, seeing how he did.  Obviously he didn\\'t play, but I still kind of followed them, and like I said, I liked their style of play, their running, for the most part they\\'re a younger team, they run the floor.  Coach Brown is great at also giving his players freedom and believing in their abilities to play within in that system. Q. Do you think you fit in well with that style of play that they favor under Coach Brown? JONAH BOLDEN: Yeah, yeah, no doubt. Q. The Sixers obviously with Ben Simmons have an Australian connection with Brett Brown, as well, who was a Boomers coach and has good connection with the country.  How do you think those people in those positions can help you become more accustomed to the NBA and then get to the place you want to be as quickly as possible? JONAH BOLDEN: I think that helps.  You know, having an Australian coach, having Australian teammates definitely helps.  You know, I just know I can approach them off the court and know I can speak to them on a daily basis about anything.  I know that coming from Australia, we all have each other\\'s backs, so that definitely helps. Q. There was an under-19 team where you weren\\'t a starter and I don\\'t think Ben Simmons made that team.  Is it odd that you\\'re both on the Philadelphia 76ers right now? JONAH BOLDEN: Well, I think Ben was in high school and I was supposed to be in under-17, so I was the youngest on the team.  But no, it\\'s very funny.  They say \"Trust the process,\" for me the whole journey has been a process from day one.  Leaving Australia to play high school over here, going to two different high schools, then two years at UCLA, then going professional.  So for me it\\'s just been a whole process and I\\'m grateful for it, but I definitely believe in trusting the process.'}, 'Lonzo Ball': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=131240', 'text': \"Q. Lonzo, point guards taken 1 and 2, this is a point guard draft.  Can you just talk about how much pride you and the other point guards take competing against one another and how strong this draft is at your position? LONZO BALL: Yeah, the point guard position is very strong, and it's even stronger in the NBA.  But I know the guys that got here worked very hard and they're all very talented.  I'm happy for them.  I know they're happy for me, and we're all proud of ourselves for how we got here. Q. Lonzo, you and your family have talked about you being a Laker and it's been a dream.  What was the moment like when it actually happened? LONZO BALL: It felt great.  You know, my dad was right there, my brothers.  I know mom is watching at home and all the rest of my family.  They're all supportive, and like I said, I'm just truly blessed to be in this position. Q. What are you feeling right now?  What's going through your mind? LONZO BALL: I feel good.  Tonight was supposed to be a good night.  Definitely was, and now I'm just focused on playing.  Just want to get on the court. Q. You're going to be on the same team with players that maybe were your models growing up or in the past few years.  How do you feel about that? LONZO BALL: That should be a lot of fun.  Looking forward to meeting all those guys and getting on the court with them and trying to win. Q. I asked you this yesterday, but now that it's happened I'm going to ask you again:  Did you have a feeling?  Were you thinking this was what was going to happen today? LONZO BALL: I had a good feeling about it, and I'm glad it happened. Q. You're going to play point guard for the Lakers and now Magic Johnson is the general manager.  What is the No. 1 thing you're looking to learn from a legend like Magic Johnson? LONZO BALL: I don't think there's one thing you can learn from him.  Just everything he's going to teach me is going to be useful.  Obviously he's the best point guard to ever play, so I'm looking to go in there and just learn from day one. Q. What aspect of Magic's game did you admire the most and what parts of your game do you think are similar to his? LONZO BALL: Definitely his playmaking ability.  He's one of the best to ever do it, and I can't -- there's never going to be another Magic Johnson, so I'm trying to be myself, but if I can come halfway short of him, you know it's going to be good. Q. You started the night in some black dress shoes but now you have some purple and gold Big Baller Brand shoes.  When did you change your shoes and how long have you had the shoes? LONZO BALL: I had them for a minute.  Just had a good feeling, and changed them five minutes before when they was on the clock, and I'm glad they called my name. Q. On the topic of Big Baller Brand, a name that works on a lot of levels, obviously being in Los Angeles raises not just your profile but the profile of the brand, a lot of controversy on the high cost of the inventory.  Will you be trying to create lower the price, create more reasonably priced inventory for Big Baller Brand so more people can purchase them? LONZO BALL: I'm not sure.  That's something we got to talk about further down the line.  But as of now are trying to be a premium brand, so we're trying to be at the top. Q. To follow up on that, do you feel that kind of makes you a target for endorsers who wear other brands, the Nikes, et cetera, that they're endorsing, hey, wait a minute, let's make sure we stick with our brand and in a sense Big Baller Brand in the process, does that put a target on your head, so to speak? LONZO BALL: According to the media I have a lot of targets on me, so probably. Q. You mentioned everyone could be here tonight except for your mother.  I was wondering if she shared any words with you this morning or this afternoon, and what it's been like to be with her in this process as she has remained at home. LONZO BALL: No, she still can't talk yet but she understands me.  So when I get home I'll get to talk to her.  I know she is happy at home for sure.  When I get back we'll have that conversation and it'll be a great time.\"}, 'Dwayne Bacon': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=131266', 'text': \"Q.

I scored at all three levels, and once I learn from the greatest in Michael Jordan and Kemba and all those guys, I'm going to add a lot to my game. Q. I know you talked about wanting to go higher and being motivated by being lower.  How much do you want teams to pay for making you wait this long? DWAYNE BACON: It's just all about playing my game now.  I've got a team, and I'm just going to do the best I can to make it home. Q. What were your meetings like with them?

OG ANUNOBY: I didn't work out, it was just a meeting. Q. Yeah, your meeting with them. OG ANUNOBY: It went really well.  I met them a couple times so far right now.  We have a good relationship.  I like the front office a lot. Q. Coming into tonight did you have a good idea that that's where you would end up? OG ANUNOBY: I had a feeling, but I wasn't for sure. Q. The Raptors are just like maybe one piece away from being an Eastern Conference champ.  What do you think you bring to that, and do you think they can overcome Cleveland? OG ANUNOBY: I think I bring a versatile wing defender that can defend multiple positions, and on offense hit open shots, cut to the basket, and then just create havoc on defense. Q. OG, where are you at on your rehab?  Have you thought about life in Toronto?  Have you been to Toronto? OG ANUNOBY: Yeah, I was in Toronto a couple days ago.  My rehab, I'm two months ahead of schedule right now, I'm starting to do a lot more on the court, I started running.  I should be back full go October, November. Q. Have you thought about how you'll fit in with the guys there?  Obviously they have some All-Star level talent and supporting pieces, as well?  Have you thought about how you're going to fit in? OG ANUNOBY: Like on the court? Q. Yeah, they've been looking for a two-way three for a long time, as well. OG ANUNOBY: Yeah, just playing hard on both ends of the court, bringing that, and just defensively guarding everyone, being able to switch on different positions.\"}, 'Ike Anigbogu': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=131271', 'text': \"Q. Would you make a statement about what you think you'll bring to your team. IKE ANIGBOGU: Definitely the things I provided at UCLA, just energy, just a guy who's willing to put it all on the floor, do all the dirty work, rim protection, rebounding, mobility on the perimeter, being able to switch some possessions, everything like that, and just a guy who's going to continue to work on his game and evolve. Q. You worked out with the Pacers; what did you learn about the organization during your workout? IKE ANIGBOGU: Oh, definitely just looking for guys who are going to work hard and trust into their program.  I met with the head coach over there.  He told me he wants me to continue doing the things I did at UCLA, and that's where people found value and don't stray away from that stuff.  So I am totally going to embrace that as I am in the program. Q. Being a rookie in the league, how much will that help you to have your teammate TJ there? IKE ANIGBOGU: Definitely.  This is a really great moment.  We already have the connection and he's my boy, he's been my boy for a long time, so this is a great opportunity. Q. Was it difficult for you to slip down the draft board a little bit?  I know you thought you would have been taken a little higher. IKE ANIGBOGU: I mean, I wasn't necessarily trying to think about where I was going to be picked, just the right program.  I had a great workout with them, they have TJ, so basically this is the No. 1 pick in my heart, so I'm just going to go there and show it all out. Q. Do you have any Indiana ties or are you fresh to the Hoosier State? IKE ANIGBOGU: Yeah, I'm pretty fresh to the Hoosier State.  I don't really have any connections, but I'm going to enjoy my time there. Q. How much do you know about the other big guys who play for the Pacers so far? IKE ANIGBOGU: Well, when I was working out over there, they mentioned Myles Turner a lot.  They said he's not only a 5 man but he can play the 4, too, and I'm usually a 5, so I can see some mixing there with him.  And yeah, just being able to play with him, alongside him, and TJ, as well, it's a great opportunity.\"}, 'Jarrett Allen': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=131252', 'text': \"Q. Jarrett, if you could start with an opening statement about what you're going to bring to Brooklyn, please. JARRETT ALLEN: Being drafted by Brooklyn, just going to bring a level of intensity.  Try to leave my mark here and just try to bring everything I have. Q. Did you work out or interview with Brooklyn? JARRETT ALLEN: Yes, I ended up interviewing with them. Q. How long ago? JARRETT ALLEN: Actually yesterday. Q. When you found out that Brook Lopez was traded, what thoughts came across your mind? JARRETT ALLEN: I mean, that opens up another spot for me to go in and play. Q. In this process you go and see so many teams, you met yesterday, you got drafted.  How does that play out? JARRETT ALLEN: I mean, yeah, it's interesting to me, but hey, I can't complain, I'm in the NBA now.  It's been a dream. Q. And you don't have to go real far tomorrow. JARRETT ALLEN: Right, it's only like a 40-minute drive with traffic, so I don't mind. Q. Describe to me the moment that you first fell in love with the game of basketball. JARRETT ALLEN: You know, it was probably around sophomore year of high school.  You know, that's when I decided I completely loved the game, and then just playing with my teammates is like -- probably just during a game.  It was like, man, I really love playing this, I love being out here, and from that day forward, I put my full heart into it. Q. Can you explain to me why you fell in love with it so late.  Earlier did you not really know if you wanted to go professionally? JARRETT ALLEN: No, I mean, it's always been a dream to go professionally.  I feel it's the difference between loving it and liking something, but I liked basketball a lot, it's just I put love high on my list. Q. How much are you looking forward to playing with young players like D'Angelo Russell, Sean Kilpatrick? JARRETT ALLEN: I mean, I'm looking forward to it a lot.  Having young players, I feel like it creates good chemistry.  You don't have older players, everybody has the same goal of trying to become the best they can.  So it's going to be good for me. Q. What type of love, what type of skill set are you going to bring to this team? JARRETT ALLEN: Mostly defensive, like blocking shots, guarding pick-and-rolls, just doing everything on that end.  And then on the offensive game, I have a pretty basic skill set, just kind of back to the basket, trying to work on my face-up game and shot. Q. Is there anything you think you need to improve? JARRETT ALLEN: Well, definitely my strength, I need to bulk up to be able to play center in this league. Q. At what age did you start playing basketball and why? JARRETT ALLEN: You know, I started playing basketball probably when I was young.  I don't remember how old I was exactly, but I played because my older brother plays it, and so like, wow, I wanted to be like him and play it.  So I just started playing it, and then I got to here. Q. What's something that you learned important off the court from Coach Smart? JARRETT ALLEN: Off the court?  You're going to have your down days.  You can't let your down days define you.  You're going to have to fight through that and just bring your best the next day. Q. When you met with the Nets yesterday, did they discuss how they wanted high-character individuals and they were trying to build a culture? JARRETT ALLEN: Yes, they said they wanted high-character individuals, people that are not going to bring toxicity to the team. Q. What do you see yourself bringing to this offense or defense with Kenny Atkinson's system? JARRETT ALLEN: I mean, honestly I'm not too familiar with the system, how they play, but just like bringing a level of intensity on both sides of the floor. Q. Where do you think you are in your development?  Do you feel like you're just scratching the surface?  From 1 to 10, where do you feel you are as far as potential, thinking about yourself? JARRETT ALLEN: Honestly, I'm not good at rating where I am like personally, but I think I have a lot more to go.  I feel like my ceiling is actually really high. Q. Yesterday I talked to you and your dad and he was obviously beaming.  What's his reaction right now?  I know he was really excited leading up to it. JARRETT ALLEN: He was just really proud.  He's always been really proud of me, but to see me finally picked, walk across that stage and shake his hand meant a lot to him.  He couldn't stop smiling. Q. Any advice? JARRETT ALLEN: No, not yet.  We're definitely going to talk about it tonight with my family. Q. Are you excited about being here in Brooklyn, Manhattan? JARRETT ALLEN: Yeah, I'm excited about being here.  It's a busy city, busy life.  I mean, personally I could do with a little more trees, but I'm happy to be here. Q. A tree grows in Brooklyn. JARRETT ALLEN: Right, but not as much as Texas. Q. Did you see the Nets play last year at all? JARRETT ALLEN: Every now and then, but honestly, not a lot. Q. I've got to ask about the hair.  Great 'fro.  What's your motivation to grow it? JARRETT ALLEN: I mean, it's really just been my thing.  It's always been with me, so I'm really not big into hair styles, and it's the easiest one for me. Q. Was it a tough decision for you to decide to leave Texas, and what went into that decision on your end? JARRETT ALLEN: I mean, yeah, it was a tough decision to leave.  We ended up being 11-22 over the year.  I felt we were a lot better than that, honestly.  For me I wanted to go back and prove that we're better than that record, we can do better than this, but it was just my time to leave personally.\"}, 'Bam Adebayo': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=131251', 'text': 'Q. Could you start out with an opening statement about what you\\'ll bring to the Heat, please. BAM ADEBAYO: You know, I bring athleticism.  I bring defense.  I bring energy. Q. Bam, going to South Beach, going to Pat Riley, Erik Spoelstra, Hassan Whiteside, what do you think about the team and the environment? BAM ADEBAYO: It\\'s going to be incredible.  It\\'s going to be fun.  I\\'m a rookie, but I\\'m looking forward to it.  Having Hassan Whiteside on my side, it\\'s a plus for me.  I feel like we can get every rebound, we get more stops.

BAM ADEBAYO: You know, when I went to work out, I spoke to Pat Riley.  But other than that, they seem real cool.  They seemed really interested in me, and I seemed real interested in them.  I bring a smile to everybody, and I bring a lot of energy. Q. Bam, you\\'ll get to enjoy a warmer winter than you had in Louisville.  When Jonathan Isaac was here I did ask him when he was drafted by Orlando, how he felt about not having to pay any state income tax, and he goes, yeah, I thought about that.  I was curious if that had crossed your mind or your agent\\'s mind. BAM ADEBAYO: Yeah, we\\'ve thought about it. Q. So did you study accounting at all at Kentucky? BAM ADEBAYO: I actually majored in communications. Q. After starting off bad, Miami finished the season real strong.  How excited are you to be going to a good team? BAM ADEBAYO: Just like we did at Kentucky, everybody thought we were good, everybody thought we were going to be good.  So just building with the guys, getting to know them and just getting in the gym with them. Q. What\\'s the most important thing you learned from Coach Cal off the court? BAM ADEBAYO: You know, he taught me how to be a better man.  You know, when I got there, I was a young boy, but you know, after a season I became a man.  So he made us grow up fast.  He held us accountable. Q. I wanted to talk to you about what you\\'re wearing tonight and how you chose it.  You seem to like the three-piece suit type of a thing. BAM ADEBAYO: The three-piece suit, I give all thanks to Jhoanna, Alba Legacy.  I just told her my favorite colors was navy blue, and then I got this suit. Q. Who do you pattern yourself after fashion size in the league? BAM ADEBAYO: You know, I kind of just dress honestly.  There\\'s nobody I need to dress like.  If I like it, I like it. Q. Coach Cal is known for being a sharp businessman.  I was curious if he told the Kentucky players who were going to be eligible for this draft things to do and don\\'t when it comes to business issues, choosing agents, et cetera. BAM ADEBAYO: You know, he just told us be careful.  We were always in the room, he just said, \"Be careful or how you do things because everybody is watching and you don\\'t want to get hurt.\"'}}, 2018: {'Trae Young': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=141162', 'text': \"Q. How much do you know about the city of Atlanta going in there? TRAE YOUNG: I know a little bit about the city.  I know it's a great city.  I've never been to an NFL game, so I know they've got the Falcons out there and an MLB team out there with the Braves.  I know it's a great city.  I've heard a lot from Quavo and Migos and them.  But overall, I want to get to know more about the city and stuff like that, but I know a little bit. Q. Is meeting the Migos on that list? TRAE YOUNG: I've met them before. Q. I saw you just finished up one of your interviews when you announced the trade, you were still in the Mavs hat.  What was the timeline of you finding out about that because reports had been on social media before that. TRAE YOUNG: Well, I figured out that I was going to be going to the Hawks right after the fourth pick, right after Jaren (Jackson Jr.) got announced.  So yeah, I knew that the trade had happened, but I didn't know necessarily I was going to be the fifth pick until after Jaren got announced. Q. Do you feel comfortable going to a city like Atlanta?  Is that something that you were thinking about when you were thinking about teams? TRAE YOUNG: Yeah, I would be comfortable in any city.  I lived in Portugal when my dad played overseas.  I grew up -- Oklahoma City is not a very big city, but it's 15 minutes away from Norman, Oklahoma.  It's not a small city.  Whatever city I went to, I was going to be able to be comfortable in.  I was just really excited to get to Atlanta. Q. If you could just name one thing only that you want to let the whole city of Atlanta know upon arriving, what would that be? TRAE YOUNG: The one thing? Q. Yep. TRAE YOUNG: I want to win.  That's the one thing I want to do.  I want to win. Q. There's been a lot of comparing you and Steph Curry, as I'm sure you're super aware of.  How does it feel to be going to work with a GM, Travis Schlenk, who was an assistant with the Warriors, and be almost plugged into the system that they're creating in Atlanta? TRAE YOUNG: I mean, it feels really great.  Travis is definitely trying to get it going in the right direction.  He did a lot over in Golden State.  He hired a really good staff with coach (Lloyd) Pierce.  He's a players' coach.  Just from the little time I spent out there during my workout, it was a great workout, and I really got to build a really good bond with him.  So I can't wait to get to work with them, because like me, they're all about winning and they want to win.  That's a really good start. Q. You mentioned Quavo has told you a lot about Atlanta so far.  What's he told you, and how did you get connected to the Migos in the first place? TRAE YOUNG: They came to a concert in Oklahoma City and I was able to attend and I met him there.  He actually texted me after I got picked, and he was excited.  He's a really good friend of mine, so it's pretty cool. Q. I was looking at what people wrote about Curry coming into the league; there's been a lot of criticism, similar criticism of you.  How do you take that, and how can you improve on those criticisms? TRAE YOUNG: Yeah, the criticisms are very similar.  But they're also very similar with a lot of other players and guys like Kemba Walker, guys like Chris Paul.  Steph isn't the only one.  And I think people get caught up a little bit in the fact of finding things that people can't do instead of looking at the things that the player can do.  When you look at that, I think you see the greater things in people. Me myself, I just want to go out there and work hard every day in practice and try to win games.\"}, 'Lonnie Walker IV': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=141169', 'text': \"Q. Looked like you were wiping your eyes a little bit when you got picked with your family.  Tell us about the emotions in that moment and the people that helped you get here. LONNIE WALKER IV: I just had so much blood, sweat and tears into this game.  You see your mom.  You see that beautiful smile after such great accomplishments.  It's amazing.  People don't understand where I come from.  I talked to my mom earlier today.  We don't have to worry about sharing a cheeseburger for dinner.  We don't have to worry about sharing some Doritos for breakfast.  Things of that nature.  I got her back.  Same way she got my back for the past 19 years. Q. Have you seen a video of the people in Reading, Pennsylvania, going absolutely nuts when the pick was announced? LONNIE WALKER IV: No, not yet.  I'm excited to see it. Q. This is your day, but a lot of people slept on you.  How much is it enjoying today versus ready to get after it? LONNIE WALKER IV: I'm ready to get after it right now.  If they wanted me to work out and practice right now, I'd do it.  I'm ready to compete, and at the end of the day, I want to be the best.  I'm addicted to being the best.  I'm obsessed with being the next great.  It's time to be a dog, and it's just that simple.  I've got something to prove. Q. When you think Spurs, when you hear the name Spurs, you think of the championships, Popovich.  What do you think you can contribute to this Spurs team that you see from the outside in that it needs? LONNIE WALKER IV: Whatever they want me to contribute.  It's just that simple.  Like I said with a couple of the ESPN people, if Coach Popovich needs me to dive on the floor strictly, then I'll strictly dive on the floor.  I'm going to do whatever it takes for us to get that win sooner than later, hopefully receive that championship. Q. Did you have any conversations with San Antonio prior to tonight? LONNIE WALKER IV: Not prior.  I had an interview in Chicago, but other than that, no. Q. What did they say in that interview? LONNIE WALKER IV: Just asking me questions, just about myself.  Talking about life and things of that nature. Q. I know you talked a ton about your connection to Reading, but it's been over a year now since you played in high school.  Why do you think the connection is still strong and how long do you think those fans will support you the way they do? LONNIE WALKER IV: It's just based off of motivation.  A lot of those kids, I grew up with a lot of friends who didn't have motivation and went down the wrong path.  So most of these friends and family and a lot of youth.  They're still grasping on, watching me continue to progress as a better man.  That motivates them.  A lot of these kids whenever they hit me up, I'm always positive about them, egging them on to become something special.  Thank God I got to create my message through basketball. Q. From what I've read about you, you seem to be interested in a lot of things outside of basketball.  Is there anything in particular that you're excited to talk to Coach Pop and your new Spurs teammates about? LONNIE WALKER IV: Honestly, I haven't thought about it yet.  I truly haven't.  But there's definitely going to be an abundant amount of questions that I'm going to be asking. Q. You said yesterday this hadn't sunk in.  How does it feel right now? LONNIE WALKER IV: It's amazing.  It really is.  You think about all that negativity that's been washing down your back for the past 10, 12 years and everything, and it's slowly diminishing as of right now.  It feels so good to be able to take care of my mom and my family. Q. You said you'd be willing to do whatever Pop and the organization asks of you, but do you have any individual goals for your rookie season that you kind of just have set out for yourself, separate for what you want to accomplish with the Spurs and the organization? LONNIE WALKER IV: Prove everyone wrong.  Just that simple.\"}, 'Moritz Wagner': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=141172', 'text': \"Q. Can you talk about growing up watching a guy like Dirk, such a legend from Germany.  How did he influence you into getting motivated to making the NBA stage? MORITZ WAGNER: He gave you belief.  For kids overseas, the NBA is very, very far away.  Way further than for American kids, just because it's literally further away.  It's like a dream.  And yeah, Dirk kind of gave you belief and hope. Q. You're joining a really pretty good crop of young German players in the league.  Dennis SchrÃƒÂ¶der.  Guys like that.  How do you feel about joining that crop of young, developing German players in the NBA? MORITZ WAGNER: Makes me proud.  There's obviously a national pride there that there's a new wave of players coming in.  To be part of it makes me very, very proud. Q. How do you feel you fit into the Lakers' core as currently constructed?  They're pretty young.  How do you feel you fit into that mix? MORITZ WAGNER: They play very fast.  They have a lot of talent at a lot of positions.  They're young.  They're trying to build something in Los Angeles.  They all can shoot.  Very, very skilled players.  So I'm excited.  I'm excited to go there and talk to new teammates.  It's a very exciting process.  We'll figure it out.  It's going to be very cool.\"}, 'Zhaire Smith': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=141170', 'text': 'Q. Were you a little shocked when the trade went down? ZHAIRE SMITH: Yeah, a little bit.  It hasn\\'t hit me because once I was about to get picked by the Suns, my agent said I was getting traded to the Sixers.  So I\\'m like, all right. Q. You said you worked out twice.  When you look at that roster, what excites you about being a part of it, like the things how you can fit in? ZHAIRE SMITH: They run in transition.  I feel I can be a part of that.  Ben Simmons, he can bring it up and make good passes.  I\\'m a good cutter, so he\\'ll make me look good. Q. What kind of conversations did you have with Brett Brown?  You said you worked out with the Sixers twice.  I was wondering what he might have said to you about coming to the team and what he might expect for you or what your role might be as a rookie? ZHAIRE SMITH: He was just comparing me to Kawhi Leonard.  He said, \"I really like your game.\"  It\\'s just really interesting.  He was just curious.  He was like, \"We\\'re going to make something happen.\"  Apparently, he did. Q. Why do you think the Kawhi Leonard comparisons were made, and why do you think Coach Brown felt you about that? ZHAIRE SMITH: Probably because Kawhi in college he was like a 4 and he turned him into a wing.  I guess he looked forward to turning me into a shooting guard.  And he just liked me for defense, too. Q. Do you want to get your own shoe line with Puma? ZHAIRE SMITH: Yeah, they\\'re making big moves.  If I can get my shoe line, I would like to.  Just look forward to being different.'}, 'Landry Shamet': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=141171', 'text': \"Q. What's your message to the fans in Philadelphia? LANDRY SHAMET: Coming from a coach in Coach Marshall, Wichita State, I understand the importance of playing hard all the time on defense and giving all your effort.  That's going to be me.  I'm going to do that.  I can shoot the ball.  Hopefully come in and be somebody that can be a threat from the three-point line.  Be somebody that's going to want to do whatever I can to help the team win.  Do my part.  Be the best player I can be for the Sixers and the city of Philly. Q. What do you know about the current Sixers roster?  Obviously you know the players, but how do you think you see yourself really fitting into a team that's ready to take that next step into true contention? LANDRY SHAMET: Yeah, obviously it's been a roller coaster in Philly and a really quick turnaround the last couple years.  Going from really rough to now a playoff contender, a serious threat in the East.  Obviously guys like Ben Simmons, Joel Embiid.  Ben being a ball-dominant guy, me being a point guard, I think I'll fit perfectly.  I'll be able to play seamlessly, being that I can play both guard spots, can guard both guard spots. Be a threat from the three-point line.  Ben needs space and is good in space and being able to create, and I think I can be a useful weapon for him.  Joel Embiid is going to attract a lot of attention as well.  So you have those two guys there that are going to attract a lot of attention.  I can be on the perimeter and kind of help in that way. Q. What did you learn about yourself your first year at Wichita State when you sat out with an injury and how did you continue to improve? LANDRY SHAMET: I think when you have an injury like that and you have what you love taken away from you, you've got to adjust and find a way to learn from a different perspective.  That's exactly what I did.  I wasn't able to learn through playing and making mistakes, but I got to watch two guys in Ron (Baker) and Fred (VanVleet), and just how they were pros and how they played.  So I learned a ton.  I think that year was honestly a blessing in disguise for me.  I don't know if I'm here if it's not for that year.  I learned a ton from it.  It was huge for me.  It allows me to be able to learn from that, from watching, not always just doing. Q. When you worked out for the Sixers, did they say anything about how they would like to utilize you next year?  Would it be maybe going down to the G League or did they say anything about being stashed overseas for a season? LANDRY SHAMET: They didn't say anything about being stashed overseas.  We didn't talk in depth about, if you come here you're going to play X games in the G League or whatever.  It's obviously going to be a conversation.  I feel confident that I can come in and contribute early.  We talked about, like I said, being able to utilize me as a lead guard that can play off the ball with Ben, and be a three-point shooting threat and guard both guard spots.  I feel like I can come in and be a contributor, be able to help.\"}, 'Collin Sexton': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=141155', 'text': \"Q. How would you describe your game and what you'll bring to the NBA level right away? COLLIN SEXTON: Just being able to play both ends of the basketball court, being able to go out there and play defense and also being able to score the ball.  But the most important side is the defensive side just because of all the players you have to go against night in, night out. Q. Obviously you don't know what the future is going to bring with free agency and everything and what he might do, but what is the opportunity to potentially play alongside LeBron James in Cleveland mean to you? COLLIN SEXTON: It means a whole lot just because he's one of the best players to ever play basketball.  Just being able to come in and learn from him, it'll be big for me and big for my growth. Q. You said you worked out in Cleveland.  Did you get a chance to see the city at all, Rock & Roll Hall of Fame? COLLIN SEXTON: No, sir.  When I was there, it was more strictly about business and being able to have a good workout.  But I did get to go to Game 4. Q. Did you have an opportunity to meet LeBron James? COLLIN SEXTON: No, I didn't meet LeBron. Q. You played for an NBA coach in college, Avery Johnson.  What did you learn from him in college that could possibly help you at this level? COLLIN SEXTON: Man, he taught me a whole lot on the court as well as off the court, but on the court he taught me how to run the pick-and-roll, also how to make sure my teammates and everybody was in the flow of the game.  Off the court, he always just told me be respectful to everybody, and also just make sure that you're aware of your surroundings because you never know what's happening around you.\"}, 'Jerome Robinson': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=141158', 'text': 'Q.

JEROME ROBINSON: Yeah, they\\'ve got some things going in Raleigh, so we\\'ll see. Q. I saw that you worked out with Russell Westbrook last summer.  Do you plan on working out with him again, and what did you learn from working out with him? JEROME ROBINSON: Yeah, we had the same trainer, so our workouts kind of overlapped.  Getting to watch him and learn from him and ask him questions and stuff like that was huge.  I mean, like not physically working out with him and stuff like that, but same idea, same kind of things.  Just kind of soaking it in and being a sponge from a guy like that, an MVP, that\\'s not something you get to see and talk to every day. Q. What\\'s the most valuable thing you learned from him? JEROME ROBINSON: Just kind of find your game and being great at it.  That was something we kind of talked about.  Just different things that he saw being in the NBA and his transition and things that kind of everybody goes through.  He was giving me a heads up so I see them coming before I get blindsided with certain things. Q. How does it feel to be the first lottery pick in Boston College history? JEROME ROBINSON: It\\'s exciting, man.  I just really worked and believed in it.  I\\'m really at a loss for words.  It\\'s awesome. Q. You were an under-the-radar guy even during the college season.  When did you realize that it was possible that you would be a first-round pick, and pretty high at that? JEROME ROBINSON: Yeah, I would say once the year was wrapping up with Coach talking to me and different things like that.  Then I had my end-of-year meeting with Coach, and he was like, not really kicking me out the door, but he\\'s like, \"You had a great year, and you\\'re definitely going to be a first-round pick.\"'}, 'Michael Porter Jr.': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=141166', 'text': 'Q. Did you get a chance to know Denver at all in terms of getting to -- MICHAEL PORTER JR.: Honestly, I just got on the phone with their coaches.  We really haven\\'t had much conversation -- Q. You didn\\'t do the workout, the usual -- MICHAEL PORTER JR.: Yeah, I met them one time.  They were a little surprised that I was still on the board.  So this is the first time we\\'ve really talked.  They sound great, and I can\\'t wait to get to know them. Q. What has this process felt like for you?  This time last year you\\'re thinking maybe the chance to go No. 1 overall, and then a lot of things outside of your control result in a different set of circumstances.  What has this process been like for you? MICHAEL PORTER JR.: It\\'s been a roller coaster, for sure.  It\\'s had its ups and its downs, but I think God has been the driver of it all.  It was crazy because I was working out for a month straight, hearing from the very top teams in the draft, and that little episode of that hip pain happened and all the top teams are a little scared.  I feel like that was God and maybe he didn\\'t want me to go to one of those teams.  I\\'m excited about it, and I\\'m looking at it in a positive way. Q. At the table in the draft, what was the feeling when you weren\\'t hearing your name called?  I know you\\'ve tried to be stress-free.  What was the stress level?  Were you starting to get a little agitated, or what was your feeling? MICHAEL PORTER JR.: No, I\\'m not going to lie to you, I was stressed out.  All that stress was overcome by joy the moment I got called, no matter what number it was.  It\\'s been my dream since I was a kid. At the end of the day, the draft is a number and I wasn\\'t going to let an ego get in the way of my joy. I\\'m happy to be where I\\'m at, and I feel like it\\'s the perfect situation for me. Q. I just want to clarify, you had no contact with Denver prior to today? MICHAEL PORTER JR.: I think they were at my pro day and I shook their hand.  I talked to the -- I think it was the GM, either the GM or the owner today.  That was my first time talking to them. Q. Earlier today? MICHAEL PORTER JR.: Earlier today, yep. Q. What was going through your mind when you heard Knicks\\' fans yelling and basically chanting your name? MICHAEL PORTER JR.: Honestly, I was feeling bad for if it wasn\\'t me, the kid that did get drafted in New York.  That\\'s my guy, and I\\'m happy for him.  When a kid gets drafted, I\\'m looking at them and I\\'m feeling joy, too, because their dreams are coming true, too.  Honestly, I was going to be happy that they accepted me.  But if it wasn\\'t me, I mean, I\\'m a little sad for the dude that got drafted there.  But I was glad they clapped, and I\\'m happy for Kevin (Knox). Q. Aside from the hip issue, do you think this was -- what led you to be taken 14th?  People see this as unexpected, borderline unprecedented drop in the draft.  Do you think it was the fact that you barely played last season?  Some negative press came out about your attitude, the hip issue.  Do you think these all combined to what happened tonight and was some of that a bit off base? MICHAEL PORTER JR.: Yeah, honestly, the teams at the very, very top of the draft told me last week I was their guy, they were going to take me.  Then the hip episode happened, and then doctors got involved and they got scared.  So once one team gets scared, a lot of them get scared.  And that\\'s what caused the drop. Like I said, I consider it a blessing because maybe the team I was going to go to at the top wasn\\'t the right team for me.  For me, we\\'re all in the NBA now.  We\\'ll see who are the best players and we\\'ll see who should have been the top draft picks.  I\\'m just happy that it\\'s over with and I know I\\'m going. Q. If we had spoken two hours ago when you were walking into the building with all your friends and fellow draftees.  Two hours ago where did you think you were going to go? MICHAEL PORTER JR.: I was hopeful that -- obviously you want to get drafted as high as you can, I\\'m not going to lie.  But I was hopeful Sacramento because that was one of the teams that was like -- Memphis, Dallas, they were all really, really interested.  I was hopeful that they would still not worry about the back.  I understand that\\'s going to get right and this is about the long-term.  I had no expectations.  But then when you\\'re sitting there at your table and another pick goes by and another pick goes by and you start seeing all your friends going, you start getting a little anxious. Q. Your parents, your family and your agent have had your back through this, and tonight what did you see and hear from them as they were sort of going through the anxiety along with you? MICHAEL PORTER JR.: Honestly, through those dark times that I\\'ve had -- I don\\'t want to say \"dark\"; those harder times for me to say positive -- it\\'s been my family, my agent who keep telling me positive things and keep making me believe the right things.  They all believe in me.  They all know I\\'m going to do great in this league and I\\'m going to have a long, successful career.  Their whole message to me was you want to be with the organization that believes that as well.  That happens to be the Denver Nuggets, and I\\'m very, very thankful. Q. Just to follow up on your Denver contact today, did the Nuggets give you an indication they were going to pick you then? MICHAEL PORTER JR.: They were like, we don\\'t think you\\'re going to make it to 14.  You\\'ve never even been on our board.  We thought you would be far gone.  But if you do, that would be awesome.  We\\'ll take it into consideration.'}, 'Elie Okobo': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=141174', 'text': \"Q. It's three straight years of a French player being picked in the first round.  Talk about the influence you guys have had on the French basketball players coming up and just the talented crop of young guys like yourself from France. ELIE OKOBO: Yeah, there's a lot of good players in France.  Those who are already in the NBA, it's an example for us.  We're trying to work hard to get there and play against them and see them in the national team, too.  Yeah, it's really an example.  Everybody in France wants to come in the NBA, and today it happened for me.  So I'm really happy.\"}, 'Dzanan Musa': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=141175', 'text': \"Q. Can you talk about the influence that Jusuf Nurkic has on you?  You join him as the only other Bosnian playing in the NBA.  Talk about that. DZANAN MUSA: Yeah, he's a really great guy.  He's a really good mentor.  He's a little bit older than me, but he knows how to manage the younger players and I get advice from him a lot.  I'm very thankful that I have that man on my national team and in my country. Q. What do you strive to achieve in the NBA to hopefully bring more light to the Bosnian players growing up like yourself a couple years back? DZANAN MUSA: I want to have, first of all, work ethic, to show them how it's done.  Work hard every day, stay humble, not get obsessed with media, with social media.  Stuff like that.  I just want to be humble and show them how it's done. Q. I'm also a young player from Europe.  I'm from Ireland.  I came here three years ago in pursuit of my dreams.  What advice would you give young players like me?  I'm a recruit, also, and I'm here now in the States.  What advice would you give 17-year-olds and 18-year-olds in the country that are chasing this big dream. DZANAN MUSA: First of all, don't listen to anybody.  The social media and agents and parents and who you have, your siblings, will talk all the other stories.  You have to stay in your lane.  You stay in your path and anything is possible.  When it comes to sports, anything is possible. Q. The human body is obviously a huge thing playing this game of basketball.  How important is your mindset?  How important is the mental in this? DZANAN MUSA: I think the most important thing is your mental strength and your basketball IQ.  You have (Nikola) Jokic from Serbia in Denver, he doesn't have a muscle in his body and he's still one of the best centers in the NBA.  You have to have it in your head. Q. How does it feel to be drafted in your home now, Brooklyn? DZANAN MUSA: I was just talking about it.  I started to cry.  When you get drafted to the home and in the building where you're going to spend like most of the time of the year, I'm very happy.  This is truly a blessing from God. Q. What do you think you can bring to the Nets organization?  Have you spoken to Kenny Atkinson?  Have you spoken to Sean Marks? DZANAN MUSA: First of all, I can bring confidence and energy on the court.  Playing through offense to spread a lane and to play hard defense.  Just be a great team player to the Nets. Q. Was there any reason specifically you were set on coming to the NBA this year rather than doing another year in Europe like some teams may have wanted? DZANAN MUSA: Yeah, most teams wanted for me to stay in Europe, but as I said, if you want to chase your dreams, you have to just listen to yourself.  My heart told me that my place is here.\"}, 'Kevin Knox': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=141160', 'text': 'Q. New York obviously can be a tough place to play because of all the media.  How do you feel about that?  And the fact that you played at Kentucky, a place where basketball is so popular, does that help you? KEVIN KNOX: Yeah, that helps a lot.  At Kentucky, it\\'s basically as big as the way the Knicks is in the NBA.  Kentucky is a powerhouse school in college basketball, so I think it gets you ready.  You play a lot of top games on ESPN, packed crowds everywhere.  That\\'s kind of how Madison Square Garden will be.  I think Kentucky helped me really well.  I think it\\'ll be really fun. Q. I know there\\'s a lot of emotion going on, but last year they drafted Frank Ntilikina, KP is young, you\\'re young.  Do you like the idea of a franchise who\\'s willing to take young guys and go? KEVIN KNOX: I love Frank.  I know he works really hard.  I think me, him and Porzingis, alongside some of the other great guys on the team, I think are going to do really fine.  Frank is a great point guard who is coming up in the NBA right now.  Porzingis, one of the best players in the NBA.  And you\\'ve got me, who is real young and is willing to work, willing to get better.  I think us three is going to be really good together. Q. During a Hot 97 interview earlier today you referred to the Knicks as \"we.\"  Did they make a guarantee to you? KEVIN KNOX: No, they didn\\'t.  I saw that after.  I think it was just an accident.  I think it was just the way I was speaking.  But hey, look where I\\'m at now.  I\\'m playing with the New York Knicks, so I guess that had to do something with it. Q. Since you were in Kentucky have you ever visited Fort Knox? KEVIN KNOX: I have not.  I\\'ve got to get there. Q. Being that you\\'re in New York, what is the first thing you want to do now that you\\'re here? KEVIN KNOX: I\\'ve been here a lot of times, but one thing I haven\\'t done is tried the pizza.  I heard they\\'re really known for their pizza.  I haven\\'t had pizza in New York, so that\\'s something everyone is telling me to do.  I\\'m really looking forward to getting some pizza. Q. When you hear fans chanting Michael Porter\\'s name, what\\'s your reaction to that? KEVIN KNOX: That\\'s just motivation.  A lot of people want him to get to the Knicks, but I mean, it\\'s all good with me.  I\\'m ready to get to work.  I\\'m ready to get to work and ready to prove people in Summer League and prove people in the NBA.  They booed Porzingis (on draft night) and look where he is now.  That\\'s the same mindset I\\'m going to have.  They can chant Michael Porter all they want.  But they got Kevin Knox, and I\\'m willing to work and I\\'m willing to get better. Q. Do I understand correctly that you played quarterback? KEVIN KNOX: Yes, sir. Q. When did you make the commitment to go basketball full-time, and what does playing quarterback help you with? KEVIN KNOX: Yeah, playing quarterback, I played until my sophomore year in high school.  So you have to have quick reactions.  You\\'ve got to be able to know pretty much everything that\\'s going on on the field, lateral quickness, lateral movements in the pocket.  I mean, football is a little bit different as far as lifting weights.  We lifted weights every day.  It\\'s a different type of sport.  So those things, different aspects, they help you in basketball. Q. You talked about your enthusiasm being on the Knicks and how their team is really, really young.  Because of that and your self-confidence, do you expect to start the season, or are you happy if it ends up being like a role off the bench? KEVIN KNOX: I mean, it doesn\\'t really matter where I\\'m at.  I\\'m going to go in with the mindset that I\\'m going to compete every day and work hard to have a starting spot.  But nothing is guaranteed, especially in the NBA.  Fizdale is going to let me fight for the position, fight for the spot.  I know I\\'m going to have to earn it, but I\\'m willing to work.  Nothing is guaranteed.  The goal is to start, and I\\'m going to compete for that starting spot. Q. Obviously you\\'re young and your game is growing, but what do you think you bring to the Knicks right now? KEVIN KNOX: My versatility.  I think I can pretty much play all around the floor.  I can handle the ball, pick-and-roll situations, make plays, make passes.  I can stretch the floor, shoot the ball, get rebounds, push it coast to coast.  So I think that versatility in the league is something that a lot of teams really need, and I think that\\'s something I can bring to the Knicks right now.'}, 'Jaren Jackson Jr.': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=141154', 'text': \"Q. Was there a part of you that was thinking about continuing on with your college education, to graduate, to come in a little bit later? JAREN JACKSON JR.: I'm still going to graduate. Q. What are you studying over at Michigan State? JAREN JACKSON JR.: I was a communications major.  I'm going to continue working on that, and I'm definitely going to graduate.  Yeah, I've got a mom, so she's on me.  I've got to do that for me and her.  It's very important in our family. Q. What are some of your favorite artists? JAREN JACKSON JR.: Well, I'm a young gun, so probably guys I would say you have no idea who I'm talking about.  I'd probably say some Lil Uzi.  Because I'm in Memphis, I've got to shout out BlocBoy.  You've got to say that.  You're nodding, but I know you don't know. Q. Your father played 12 years in the league; at what age did you want to be an NBA player? JAREN JACKSON JR.: I wanted to be an NBA player probably as long as I can remember.  I can't really even -- it's everybody's dream.  We dream about this every day, and we dream about this moment probably more than you can think of.  It's surreal. Q. And when did you start to believe that it could actually happen, it was realistic? JAREN JACKSON JR.: Probably when you hit your late growth spurt.  I used to be shorter, so it wasn't always something you really think about.  I was more playing for fun.  I always loved it.  But more and more serious as I got my height and as I grew into it and started playing with it more, it just becomes more and more of a thing.  I can't really point to one moment.  I think it was just gradual.  That just builds confidence. Q. Now that you're in the NBA, I know you're really excited leading up to this, but what's the next week of your life going to be like?  What's your schedule?  Are you going there right away? JAREN JACKSON JR.: I think that's like flight information, so I've got to like ask my agent.  I really don't know.  Brain is kind of turned off right now. But you know, I'm definitely going to try to see some family for a couple days while I've got the opportunity and then just try to get back to my routine, just get back to it.  This was a great night, but it's one night.  We're getting ready for Summer League, and that's where our focus is now. Q. I don't know if you saw, but Miles was drafted right before you walked in -- JAREN JACKSON JR.: I saw.  I was watching. Q. What's it like for you to come into the league together and the communication between you guys leading up to the draft? JAREN JACKSON JR.: Oh, my gosh, we've been hanging out like every day in the room, like, man, this is about to happen.  Like every day up to this point we've been in New York, we've just probably been just thinking about it. To get drafted with your teammate especially, not many people get to do that.  It's pretty frequent this year you see the Kentucky guys and you see the Villanova guys.  It's a great feeling, trust me. Q. What's the inspiration behind your wardrobe tonight? JAREN JACKSON JR.: Oh, well, I'm glad you asked.  There's a lot of different things.  I definitely like to dress like how I see myself acting.  I'm pretty loud, excited.  I'm happy pretty much 90 percent of the time except when we cross that line, then it's business.  But off the court I'm just excited a lot, so this is just like a loud suit.  I like to make a statement.  You only get drafted one time, so I wanted to do it.  But I'm a young guy, so I don't think anybody expected me to do something meaningful, Rock the Vote.  No one expected me to do that.  Youngest one here doing something like that.  I think that's important.  I'm voting for the first time next year, which is probably weird.  Not many people doing that. So I'm happy.  I'm happy to do something like this.  JC Penney hooked me up.

What was the wait like to get picked 22 and just the feeling when you finally got word they were going to be the team? CHANDLER HUTCHISON: Yeah, really it was just exciting.  I was waiting from pick 1.  I didn't know really what was going to happen.  Just excited to hear that.  And then to see that it's with Chicago, once it finally sinks in where you're going, it's just amazing.  It's a blessing. Q. Did the Bulls tell you they were going to pick you? CHANDLER HUTCHISON: No, I didn't have any guarantee on where I was going.  It could have been anywhere.  Honestly, my heart was racing really from 15 on.  It was just an exciting moment, though. Q. Now that it's happened, what are the emotions when you think about where you came from to get to this point and your whole team at Boise State cheering for you? CHANDLER HUTCHISON: Yeah, those are my guys.  I've been at Boise State for four years, so I've had a lot of teammates and spent a lot of time with them.  The support from them has been great, and I know they're watching.  It's a special feeling not only for me but I know for them, too, because the work that we all put in.  It's kind of like paying respect to that and seeing that it does pay off. Q. You kind of said you're ready to just get started.  Now that you have a team and you know it's Chicago, how do you think you fit there and how excited are you to finally get going? CHANDLER HUTCHISON: Yeah, I think it's a great fit.  I feel like there's need at the wing position for them to kind of add to their core that they have.  It's not very often where you feel like what you get is a really great fit.  You end up going wherever you end up going.  But in this case, it's just special to see that it was with Chicago.  Great fanbase.  I'm so blessed, and I'm ready to go right now. Q. How familiar are you with Wendell Carter as a player, as a person, and have you guys talked at all about pairing up in Chicago?  Did you know him at all before the draft? CHANDLER HUTCHISON: I am a basketball junkie, so I'm always watching TV and Duke shows up on TV pretty often.  I've seen his game and seen what they've been able to do.  He's a special talent.  There's a reason why he was the No. 7 pick in the draft.  Just lucky to get a player like him to be able to kind of have that one-two rookie duo to be able to just grow together and make a name for ourselves. Q. You said you were dreaming about this.  Talk about the moment it happened.  Was it what you thought it would be like? CHANDLER HUTCHISON: Yeah, it was everything and more, really.  Like you said, I was just dreaming about it.  All the emotions just kind of come out, and you just feel every little ounce of the pain of working hard and getting to this moment.  It's a good feeling, and I'm just ready to start the next chapter because I know this isn't the final step of anything. I understand being a rookie in this league is hard, but I've done a lot of things that have been hard and put hard work into this game.

How excited are you to be playing in the same league as them and compete against them on a fairly regular basis? AARON HOLIDAY: I'm very excited.  I haven't gotten to play against my brothers since I was younger.  They obviously used to beat me up back then, win all the games.  So we'll see next year, I guess. Q. What do you know about Indiana? AARON HOLIDAY: I know a lot about the team.  A lot of Bruins there.  Victor Oladipo is really good.  They have some good young bigs.  It's also a great city.  My sister-in-law is from there, so I know a little bit about that. Q. What are you hoping to bring to the squad? AARON HOLIDAY: Just somebody that will come in and just work.  Somebody that can help the team right away, whether that's getting to the basket, assisting, shooting the open three, spacing the floor, and obviously my defense.  I feel like I can really help on defense. Q. This is obviously a dream come true for you, but when did you think you might be able to be an NBA player? AARON HOLIDAY: I think when I was maybe my sophomore year to junior year.  I worked really hard on my game, and I was really starting to pretty much be able to dominate.  That's when I really felt like I could be an NBA player.  As long as I kept working hard and I stayed focused, I thought I could make it. Q. When you were a kid, when did it first dawn on you that your brothers might be NBA-level players? AARON HOLIDAY: Well, growing up I always thought they were good enough to be NBA players.  I have extreme confidence in my family and myself, so I pretty much knew at a young age that they were going to make it.\"}, 'Shai Gilgeous-Alexander': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=141164', 'text': \"Q.

I feel like I fit really well with them and had a great workout and dinner with those guys and feel really comfortable.  I guess I feel like I'm on top of the world. Q.

I noticed there was this square of fabric on the table next to me while I was getting fitted.  It had this pattern and this color.  I tried it on the trim of my jacket at first.  I liked that a little bit and then I tried the whole jacket and figured out I really liked it.  Then I put the whole suit together and fell in love. Q.

Tell me your thoughts on the possibility of playing with Dennis Smith, Jr., and what do you know about the Mavericks as far as Dirk Nowitzki? LUKA DONCIC: Yeah, I saw a lot of Dennis.  He's an amazing player.  He's an amazing point guard.  And of course Dirk Nowitzki, he is example for everybody.  He's achieved so much.  He's a legend.  He's a leader.

Talk about your success over in Europe, EuroLeague MVP and how that high level of success will translate to the NBA game? LUKA DONCIC: I think it will happen.  I've been professional since I was 15.  I played against EuroLeague stars, against ex-NBA players.  I had four or five players on my team that played in the NBA.  They've been talking about the NBA to me a lot through this year.

I was so excited for Mikal (Bridges) to get his name called and I saw the moment he shared with Coach Wright.  Shortly after, I got to share that same exact moment.  Honestly, I think I'll share that moment with Coach Wright and that bond with Coach Wright forever. Q. What was your workout like with Milwaukee, and what did the coaches say to you after you were done? DONTE DiVINCENZO: The workout with Milwaukee, I just went out there and visited.  It was toward the end.  And we sat down and we talked for a while.  I talked to Coach, and I sat with the front office and a couple other players were there.  Malcolm Brogdon was there working out, so I got to talk to him a little bit.  Everyone was just welcoming.  Everybody was great.  They were great people, and they really took interest in me.  They treated me great there.  I'm just thankful to be a part of their organization. Q. How does it feel to play with Giannis? DONTE DiVINCENZO: Unreal.  I mean, you talk about a superstar, one of the best players in the league right now.  Like I said, my job is just go in there and make sure he has all the confidence in the world that I'm on the court with him. Q. How has Villanova prepared you for this? DONTE DiVINCENZO: Villanova is the reason I'm sitting in this chair right now.  Coach Wright and the coaching staff have done a good job developing me as a player and as a young man.  Now it's my job to take everything I've learned from Coach Wright and the coaching staff and applying it to myself. Q. What's the reaction you're getting from people back home? DONTE DiVINCENZO: I take real big pride in that.  Delaware, the support that I get from Delaware, I mean, there are thousands of people reaching out to me.  Whenever I go home, it's just so welcoming anywhere I go and everybody is noticing me. Q. How impactful were the six games of the NCAA Tournament in you deciding to enter the draft? DONTE DiVINCENZO: I think it was huge.  I go back to, it's not just that one game in the championship.  I think a lot of teams have told me there's a whole body of work all year long.  But that tournament opened a lot of eyes, and not just scoring the ball.  But afterward that kind of sped up the process for me and opened the eyes of a lot of teams.  Going to the Combine I had a lot of eyes on me, high praise on me, so I had to perform well at the Combine or everything would have just went downhill. Q. How surreal has this been for you going from a sixth man, a redshirt, to a top-20 draft pick? DONTE DiVINCENZO: I think it goes back to Villanova, the development of Villanova.  Started off as a redshirt.  Mikal was the same way.  Just growing each and every day and growing by the year.  Just thankful that my time came a little bit earlier than expected. Q. We talked about this at the Combine, but if you could to the best of your abilities just reflect on the last couple of months.  This is what guys I would imagine dream of doing, national championship, 31 points.  Now you're a top-20 pick.  How can you sum it up? DONTE DiVINCENZO: Honestly, I don't know.  I have no words for it just because everything has happened so fast for me.  I think once I get to Milwaukee, do the press conference there, see the city, have a couple days to reflect on everything, then I'll really truly reflect on how blessed I am to be able to play at this level.  But it's just been one thing back to back to back, so I haven't really had time to think about anything.\"}, 'Wendell Carter Jr.': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=141161', 'text': \"Q. Wendell, Chicago, I was reading that seemed to be a destination that you seemed kind of suited.  Did you get a chance to know the city at all during this workout time?  Besides the basketball, what did you get to learn about it? WENDELL CARTER JR.: I've heard from a lot of people, it's just a clean New York City.  I think that's a good thing.  New York has a great market.  Chicago has a great market.  Yeah, that's all I know. Q. You played for arguably the greatest coach ever in Coach K.  What are some things you learned not only on the court but off the court that you will take with you? WENDELL CARTER JR.: He taught me -- one memo he lived by was living in the moment, not worrying about the future or the past but just living in the moment, allowing the moment to determine what's going to happen in the future.  That's something I live by on and off the court.  While I was out there, waiting for my name to get called, I was living in the moment, not worrying about when I'm going to get my name called or anything like that.  So that's something I lived by every single day. Q. What went through your mind when your name was called? WENDELL CARTER JR.: Nothing.  My mind went blank.  It was a surreal moment for me, something I've been looking forward to all my life.  To hear my name called, it was just like, wow, I'm really in the NBA, somewhere I've always wanted to be since I was 3 years old. Q. How do you see yourself fitting in with Lauri Markkanen and what kind of tandem do you see yourselves forming? WENDELL CARTER JR.: We're going to be unstoppable.  He's a great player.  Someone I can learn from, a great young player.  Someone I can learn from on and off the court.  And with my work ethic as I come in, I'm going to do all I have to do to help my team win.  So I think we'll definitely complement one another on both ends of the court. Q. Just a few days ago you were chiming in and saying you would have wanted Dallas to draft you as well as your parents chimed in on that.  Did you feel some sort of way -- WENDELL CARTER JR.: No, I didn't feel no type of way.  You're saying I said I wanted to be drafted by Dallas? Q. I heard you say that. WENDELL CARTER JR.: Really?  Oh.  I mean, no.  It's Chicago.  It's the seventh pick.  It's an honor.  It's a blessing.  I'm just excited to be in the NBA.\"}, 'Miles Bridges': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=141165', 'text': \"Q. What position do you think your game best translates to at the NBA level? MILES BRIDGES: I feel like I don't have a position.  I feel like you put me anywhere on the floor, I'll be comfortable.  I think that's going to be great for me coming in with Charlotte. Q. You've been banging on people your whole life, and you finally made it.  Who's the first person -- who do you have on your list? MILES BRIDGES: Draymond (Green), by far.  Yeah, definitely Draymond. Q. A lot of Kentucky players in the NBA; who have you been soaking up wisdom from? MILES BRIDGES: Kentucky?  I know Malik Monk.  John Wall.  I'm actually signed with the same agency as John Wall.  I talk to John Wall sometimes.  I know Malik.  We played against each other a lot, and he's going to be on my team.  It's going to be great playing with him. Q. Around this time a year ago you decided to return back to Michigan State; talk about now that you're at this part what made it so much more beneficial this time around versus last year when you decided to come back? MILES BRIDGES: I feel like my game has definitely matured.  I know how to play the game of basketball the right way.  I watched a lot of film.  I feel like I got better in my mental aspect of the game and my physical aspect.  I learned how to play on different parts of the floor, on the wing, on the inside.  I learned how to be an efficient player. Q. Does Jordan still challenge guys to one-on-one?  Do you think he's going to challenge you? MILES BRIDGES: I would definitely love to play MJ one-on-one.  But a lot of guys have said that and it's been bad for them, so I'm not going to try to jinx anything. Q. Now that everything is settled and you're going to Charlotte, do you wish you came out after your freshman year? MILES BRIDGES: Oh, no, I don't have any regrets.  Like I said, Charlotte is a great place.  I'm definitely going to try to make a push for the playoffs.  I'm going to give it all I've got every day. Q. There are a lot of different programs, Kansas, Kentucky, Duke, North Carolina, all these that get multiple players selected in the draft, but what does it say about the Michigan State program and Tom Izzo and just everything that they've endured as a whole to be able to pull together and you guys still staying focused, what does it say about the Michigan State program overall? MILES BRIDGES: Yeah, usually people talk about Coach Izzo not being able to develop players, but it kind of speaks for himself.  We have Draymond in the league.  Gary Harris.  Denzel Valentine.  And all those guys are doing pretty fine.  He just added two more in Jaren Jackson and myself.  I feel like Coach Izzo is great at developing people, and Michigan State as a staff is great at doing that, too.\"}, 'Mikal Bridges': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=141159', 'text': 'Q. Obviously the Sixers have one of the best kind of young cores in the NBA.  How do you envision yourself fitting in there in year one? MIKAL BRIDGES: Just coming in, doing whatever it takes, bringing that winning mentality they have and just bringing another winner.  That\\'s what Brett Brown wants.  He wants to win.  And that\\'s the same thing with me.  That\\'s why I came here; I want to win.  That\\'s the only thing I care about.  I\\'m just going to keep getting better as a player, but the main goal is definitely winning. Q. Did you have a feeling all along it might be the Sixers, and what was the wait like before you got your name called? MIKAL BRIDGES: See, I didn\\'t know where I was going to go.  You people say that you\\'re going to go to the Sixers, but it\\'s just a lot of people just talking.  But once I got that text and call that I\\'m going, I was very excited for sure. Q. There\\'s a lot of one-and-done guys in the draft, but Villanova has four players who might get drafted who spent a couple years in college.  What do you attribute that to, and what do you think that says about the program? MIKAL BRIDGES: Coach Wright, he brings us in, he turns us into the players we are today.  Other than just basketball, he turns us into great men, and I appreciate that about him.  He helped me turn into the person I am today.  He helped me build my mental toughness.  There is more about the game than physical toughness.  It\\'s the mental part, too.  If I didn\\'t go Nova, I\\'m not sure I would have ever built that. Q. Have we gotten to the point where being a little older having been a college graduate is actually a liability in this process? MIKAL BRIDGES: I don\\'t understand that.  You know, turning 22 -- Q. You\\'ve still got a lot of good years left. MIKAL BRIDGES: Yeah, of course.  I never heard of 21-, 22-year-olds are done progressing as a player.  I\\'m still young, and I\\'m going to keep getting better.  I know I\\'m going to keep progressing every year, every day until I\\'m the best basketball player I can be. Q. Being from Philadelphia, how does it feel to play there and does it present distractions for you, do you think, now that you\\'re at a new level? MIKAL BRIDGES: No.  I was at Villanova, which is close to all my family and friends, so I don\\'t feel like it\\'s no distraction.  I\\'m here to play basketball.  That\\'s what I\\'m here for.  I mean, I\\'ve got too much love and passion for this game, so there\\'s nothing that\\'s going to really set me back or keep me distracted.  I\\'m all about basketball. Q. Going off that earlier question, Villanova doesn\\'t really have a reputation of being a pro factory, but you\\'re here, four guys about to be drafted.  Do you feel like you\\'re a part of a culture change?  Is this a turning point for the program? MIKAL BRIDGES: Yeah, most definitely.  Everybody dreams to be here, especially everybody at school at Nova.  But it\\'s what Coach Wright does, how he develops his players.  If you look at me right now, not one person would probably say I\\'d be an NBA player when I came out of high school.  But people who thought that was my family and Coach Wright, and I just can\\'t thank him enough.  He just develops his players really well.  He turns them into grown men.  He does everything for you, and I\\'m so happy that I have him and he got me to this position. Q. I was wondering what kind of conversations you\\'ve had with Coach Brown about coming to the team and what your potential might be with the Sixers moving forward. MIKAL BRIDGES: Just when I worked out there, he saw my workout, talked to me after, said I did a good job.  He likes how I play.  He\\'s been watching me, knows how I can defend basically 1 through 4.  And I feel like just for me, I bring that defensive edge, that winning mentality to that winning program, and that person who\\'s going to sacrifice a lot, and that\\'s what happens, too, when you win a lot, you sacrifice a lot.  I\\'m just willing to do anything to win. Q. How excited are you to play alongside Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons? MIKAL BRIDGES: That\\'s amazing.  I mean, I watch those guys and I watch how unbelievable they are, how tough they are.  Just watching college and going to the games, watching on TV, when people tell you, oh, you could go to the Sixers, you kind of watch and see where you\\'re going to be out there, like how you fit yourself between them, and I feel like I can correlate with them pretty well for sure. Q. You just mentioned a couple people or a few people didn\\'t really believe in you coming out of high school.  How good does it feel to be here sitting here today? MIKAL BRIDGES: It means the world.  It\\'s not just me, it\\'s bigger than me.  It\\'s everybody who helped me get to this position, my family, friends, coaches, everybody.  It starts with my coach in the second grade.  Starts with my middle school coaches.  Obviously my parents.  High school coaches.  Starts with everybody.  My friends who stuck with me throughout -- growing up, elementary, middle school, high school, watching me sit out, play one year, telling our friends at other schools, \"Oh, my boy goes to Villanova,\" then I don\\'t play that one year, and they\\'re probably looking at them like \"Oh, your boy doesn\\'t play, and still not letting that change how they are with me.  It\\'s bigger than me.  It\\'s everybody who helped me get to this position. Q. How is your mom feeling about this?  Have you had a chance to talk yet? MIKAL BRIDGES: Not really, but she\\'s very, very excited.  She\\'s been wanting this.  She\\'s probably more excited than I am.  She was about to cry and all that.  She said she didn\\'t want to ruin her makeup, so she\\'d try to hold it in.  But no, she\\'s very excited.  I\\'m her only son.  I\\'m a little mama\\'s boy.  Her son is right there around the corner again, and it\\'s just really cool.'}, 'Mohamed Bamba': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=141157', 'text': 'Q. Being that you\\'re drafted, your dream has come true, what important goal do you wish to accomplish in the NBA? MOHAMED BAMBA: When it\\'s all said and done, I want to be walking across the stage and I want to be putting on a jacket that has this little seal that says \"Hall of Fame.\"  There\\'s a lot to do before there, trust me, and it\\'s a lofty goal, but that\\'s the mindset that I\\'m going to have to have to do that.  It\\'s going to be a special one. But there\\'s a lot of goals in between that.  I definitely want to be Defensive Player of the Year.  I truly believe I can be that caliber of a defender very early on in my career.  I\\'m just -- I\\'m sorry, I\\'m just excited. Q. How many of your family members, friends are here tonight jumping on that 2 train to come here? MOHAMED BAMBA: Yeah, for those of you who don\\'t know, the 2 train literally takes me a block away from my house.  It was a close commute.  It wasn\\'t really a trip, it was a commute.  But I have a lot.  I have a lot of family.  I have most of my family here.  I have all my close friends and family here.  It was like literally a 20-minute train ride. Q. Why did you choose to represent yourself? MOHAMED BAMBA: I choose to represent myself because of the importance of pre-draft training for me.  I wanted to be in full control of what I was doing pre-draft and the kind of approach that it took for pre-draft was the ร\\x83ยก la carte approach where I wanted to work with Drew Hanlen but also wanted to work with Amoila Cesar in strength training, and a different nutritionist and I wanted to be in control of finding the best specialists that I could. Q. Has it worked for you? MOHAMED BAMBA: Absolutely, absolutely. Q. You\\'re obviously bringing a 7-10 wingspan to the Orlando Magic, but I also see that you\\'ve been working on your three-point range.  Why is that important and how is it going to help the Orlando Magic deep? MOHAMED BAMBA: It\\'s very important.  Have you seen the direction of the league?  It\\'s very important because I want to be a guy who can stay on the floor for the last four, five minutes of the game and be able to stretch the floor and shoot and space the floor like that.  It\\'ll open up the floor for a lot of my teammates. Q. On the point of no agent.  Certainly now that you\\'re going to be in the highest economic strata, investing in real estate, do you have enough knowledge in those areas?  Or are you going to be looking for some specialists for how to protect your nest egg? MOHAMED BAMBA: Yeah, that\\'s a great question.  That\\'s actually an area I\\'ve explored already.  I already know what my first major is going to be and it\\'s going to be an investment, and I just want to be smart with my money.'}, 'Marvin Bagley III': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=141152', 'text': \"Q. Do you know anything about the city of Sacramento? MARVIN BAGLEY III: Oh, yeah, I know they built the new arena down in the city.  They're starting to kind of build out and build new things.  I had a great feeling when I went there, just from the people that I met walking outside and seeing how friendly the people were and just meeting new people and meeting the front office and everybody involved with the Kings.  I had a great feeling, especially working out, talking to Peja (Stojakovic), Vlade (Divac), the owner.  Everybody, man, they gave me a good vibe and a good feeling about building something.  I'm super excited to get down there and start building something. Q. You and Deandre Ayton played together in high school.  How about the fact you two did that and now you're 1 and 2 in the draft? MARVIN BAGLEY III: It's amazing.  It's amazing.  I've known Deandre for a long time.  That's like my brother, man.  We played together.  We had chemistry.  We built a relationship.  To see him live out his dream and me living out my dream, it's amazing.  It's an amazing feeling.  Like I said, I'm excited to go into this new journey. Q. What are some of the things you learned in the ACC this year that will hopefully have been a good jumping-off point for the NBA? MARVIN BAGLEY III: One thing that I've learned, especially in conference play, is that every game, especially with the team we have, you're going to get every team's best shot.  It's not going to be a game -- any game where you go in and there's going to be an easy game.  There's no such thing as easy games, and I think that will definitely help me going into the NBA level.  Bring it every night and you're going to get everybody's best shot, especially as a rookie coming in; everybody is going to want to prove to you that you shouldn't be here or try to prove a point to you.  So you've just got to be ready for that and just play and have fun and compete at a high level.  And I think that's what I'm ready to do. Q. Being in the NBA, every single game, teams are going to try and take advantage of your weaknesses.  What's the No. 1 weakness in your game you want to improve by the time you play in the NBA? MARVIN BAGLEY III: Everything.  It's a lot of things that I think I should get better at.  It's just about me studying myself, studying other players, studying basketball in general, getting better at each thing I put a finger on and choose to get better at.  There's a lot of things I'm working on to help me play at this level. Q. I heard you say if the Suns didn't pick you the first overall pick that you'd forever hold a grudge.  Do you have a fire ready for all your Phoenix Suns gear from when you were little? MARVIN BAGLEY III: No, it's not necessarily literally a fire.  It's more of a fire inside.  I'm happy.  I'm happy that I'm with the Kings.  When I said I have a lifelong chip, I definitely meant that, and I'm rolling with that.  I can't wait to get to work.  That's all I'm going to say, man.  I can't wait to get started and grow as a player.\"}, 'DeAndre Ayton': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=141153', 'text': 'Q. You\\'ve said all along you were going to be the No. 1 pick in the draft.  Now that you are, how did it feel and how does it feel? DEANDRE AYTON: Having my name called to be the first pick for the Phoenix Suns was mind-blowing.  Having all that confidence and leading up to that point when I saw Adam Silver came out, I was just waiting for my name, and when he called it, my mind went blank.  I just did the routine everyone else was supposed to do, and I just got up there and enjoyed the moment, and I saw the reaction on my mom\\'s face.  It was just priceless. Q. Take us back to that moment at the Jeff Rodgers Camp where you first fell in love with the game.  Did you even think that this was possible reaching these heights? DEANDRE AYTON: At the Jeff Rodgers Camp I didn\\'t think I fell in love with the game right there.  My mom just wanted me out of the house during the summer.  That\\'s when I really got exposed, that\\'s when the opportunities started, but it\\'s just great.  When I came to the United States, I knew what hard work was. Q. You signed with Puma, which is unusual.  How was Puma able to get your services over the bigger boys? DEANDRE AYTON: In the Bahamas a lot of people cannot afford Nike or Adidas.  Puma is the main brand and it\\'s very affordable, and growing up around that brand, I\\'m used to that brand.  And me, I want to start my own thing.  I want to be dominant in my own brand, and I want to have my own signature shoe one day to make it global. Q. What do you expect your role to be with the Phoenix Suns say three years from now, or what do you want it to be? DEANDRE AYTON: I just want to come in and be the best teammate I can be, especially be the best two-way man coming in.  The game is changing a lot, but I just want to stick to the old-school big man, being down low and really trying to be dominant. Q. I read an article that you had said that since you moved from the Bahamas, it\\'s only basketball and business, that\\'s all you\\'re going to focus on.  Do you see yourself taking a day or two to relax?  You\\'ve reached the first part of your goal, but will you take a break to go to Disneyland? DEANDRE AYTON: No, the hard work starts now.  I told my mom, you think we were working, but the hard work really starts now.  We\\'ve got a lot of work to do, and after the summer we\\'ll probably catch a breath. Q. Recently you said you were looking forward to a potential duo with Devin Booker, Shaq and Kobe 2.0.  What are you looking forward to about playing with Devin and how can you bring the Suns to the next level? DEANDRE AYTON: Basketball is really changing, so the two-man game is really hard to stop.  Having a guard like Devin Booker, who can really score the ball, and me being a big man who can really pick-and-pop, very versatile, that\\'s very dangerous.  The team in general is a very young and hungry team.  We just have to stick together, get a great chemistry and start a winning legacy in Phoenix. Q. Just talk about the influence that you hope to have to the Bahamian basketball players being No. 1 overall, and what you want to try to influence the young guys coming up to hopefully bring the country more on the platform? DEANDRE AYTON: I want to bring to the Bahamas, they don\\'t have to leave home to think that they have an opportunity.  We can bring the opportunity to them.  I can help bring the opportunity to them.  We can just start schools, we can start better basketball opportunities to really have more exposure.  Instead of coming to the United States or going overseas, we\\'ll just be at home and start our own trend. Q. It seemed like very little suspense about you going No. 1; were you even nervous at all sitting there waiting and waiting?  Was there anything going -- DEANDRE AYTON: I mean, it was a long day.  Standing around doing a lot of media, just wanted the day to get over with.  But as soon as I sat down in the green room and I saw the Commissioner coming to the podium, I really felt that -- I was nervous, my hands were sweating, I kept on asking my mom, \"You think I\\'m going No. 1?  You think I\\'m going No. 1?\"  But eventually my name was called first, and dream come true. Q. What\\'s it going to take to get back to the Bahamas again, playing for the Bahamas again?  Have you talked to the coaching staff yet? DEANDRE AYTON: No, I haven\\'t talked to anyone yet. Q. You\\'ve come a long way since the Jeff Rodgers Camp -- DEANDRE AYTON: Yeah, a long way.  It\\'s been a journey.  I\\'m going to have many more chapters to fill out.  But the only thing that can really have me continue this exposure and this type of lifestyle is just hard work.  I can\\'t stop now.  The work has just begun. Q. We\\'ve heard you\\'re a fun-loving guy.  We\\'ve heard about your alteregos.  How would you describe your personality? DEANDRE AYTON: I\\'m a very easygoing guy.  I know a lot of people think I\\'m just a big guy who\\'s just mean, and I hear \"bully season\" a lot, but it really means whatever your craft is, you want to be dominant in it.  So yeah, I\\'m just a really funny guy.  A lot of people think I\\'m just -- I do things people don\\'t want, so a lot of interviews, I\\'m very funny, and I make everybody welcome and comfortable. Q. You and Marvin Bagley go 1 and 2 and you were former high school teammates.  How about your thoughts on that? DEANDRE AYTON: I mean, it\\'s crazy.  Growing up with Marvin in high school until now, knowing what we both did, and we made history.  We\\'ve been talking about it through high school, and now here we are.  It\\'s breathtaking that my name was called and then stopped everything and then his name was called.  It\\'s just a dream.  We\\'re just making history.  We have a lot more ways to go, but I know we\\'ve got it. Q. You mentioned building chemistry with your new teammates, Devin Booker, how do you plan on doing that? DEANDRE AYTON: I\\'m in town.  They know who I am.  I hang out with Josh (Jackson).  I\\'ve been knowing Josh since high school.  It\\'s just the other guys on the team, Marquese (Chriss), Tyler Ulis, having a good relationship off the court to get to know the guys.  On the court it\\'s supposed to be natural.  You respect my game, I respect yours, you work hard, I work hard and just have respect for those guys who came before you, and just really listen and dialed in to what Coach has to say. Q. Would you talk about your jacket? DEANDRE AYTON: You can see a few of these jackets.  There\\'s a few flags in there.  My dad is from Nigeria, my mom is Jamaican and Bahamian, so I\\'m helping all those countries in one.  I\\'m not just a Bahamian.  I\\'m Nigerian and Jamaican.  So I just want to let the world know that.  Thank you. Q. You mentioned talking to your mom.  I was just curious if you had any words with Coach Miller sitting there waiting around? DEANDRE AYTON: He just said, \"I love you,\" and \"I love you too, Coach.\"  We went through a lot, and I\\'m just happy he knows the type of work I put in.  He knows I worked on my craft every day to get to this point.'}, 'Grayson Allen': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=141168', 'text': \"Q. Did you get the impression after your workouts that they were really taking a serious look at you? GRAYSON ALLEN: I did.  I got good feedback from them.  They had the Duke connection with Coach Snyder and Coach K.  Coach K heard good feedback, too.  My agent heard good feedback.  So I knew it could be serious.  I knew my name was in serious consideration.  But come draft night, everything is just up in the air, so you really have no idea.  I didn't have many expectations for the night, so I was surprised and happy. Q. I've seen you go everywhere from the most loved to the most hated.  How much has all that prepared you for this moment? GRAYSON ALLEN: I think I got thick skin now.  I'm a lot tougher mentally.  I don't care if it's boos or cheers in the stands or in opposing stands.  I think it's gotten me a lot more focused on the game and the love of the game and loving to play the game instead of all the outside external noise, cheers or boos, praise or criticism kind of things. I think my four years at Duke have been nothing but growth.  Just a lot of growth on and off the court. Q. Tell me about playing against Donovan and how you feel now about playing with him? GRAYSON ALLEN: Yeah, we had some great battles.  It's funny, the scouting report on him from freshman to sophomore year changed so much because he improved his game incredibly.  He expanded everything.  He's a competitor, so we matched up a lot.  I wanted to guard him, he wanted to guard me.  I got to look back and see what the Duke-Louisville series was.  I don't know if we split or he got me or I got him. I'm really excited to be playing with him.  Obviously, he had a really successful year.  Just looking to build on that and build on the success that the team already has.  They're going in the right direction. Q. Not a lot of guys get to walk off the draft stage and see their team's leading scorer waiting for them with a big hug.  Can you talk about what it meant to have Donovan here to welcome you into the Jazz family? GRAYSON ALLEN: It's awesome to get his support, because I obviously haven't met many guys on the Utah Jazz.  When their leading scorer and really the guy who had the ball in his hands the most from last year comes and congratulates you and welcomes you right when you put the hat on, it feels good.  I already feel welcomed in Utah.  I'm really excited to get to work there.\"}}, 2019: {'Zion Williamson': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=151228', 'text': \"Q. Could you just talk about feelings about going No. 1 overall in the draft? ZION WILLIAMSON: I don't think it's feelings I can really describe.  You know, as a little kid you say you want to go to the NBA.  People basically say, you've got to have a plan B because the chances of doing it is just little to none.  For me to be selected No. 1, I mean, I can't dream it no better than that. Q. There's been no secret about your draft position for months.  There's been no suspense here tonight that changed anything, and yet in the moment your emotions sort of welled up on you.  Can you talk about why you think that happened the way it happened tonight when you heard your name? ZION WILLIAMSON: Because I love the game of basketball.  You can hear people say things like, oh, that it was likely I was going to go No. 1, but I guess you don't know until you actually go through it.  Hearing my name called and I was able to make it on stage without a tear, shake the commissioner's hand, but in the interview my mom was standing beside me, and my emotions just took over. Q. How much responsibility do you feel to the people that have been there for you up to this point, to the people that are going to pay attention to you now, and particularly to yourself as the No. 1 pick, not just drafted into the league but the very first player of this class? ZION WILLIAMSON: Honestly, as much as responsibility, I love the game and I love to win.  Whatever the team needs me to do, I'm willing to do it, because I feel like people remember winners. Q. Just wanted to ask, to play for a guy like Coach K for however long is a privilege.  What will you take from him from everything he's taught you, the year that you've had, that could possibly make the transition to the NBA just a little bit easier for you? ZION WILLIAMSON: Just be myself and trust myself because that's what got me this far.  Just continue to do that while honing my other skills and just keep my love for the game. Q. What excites you about the roster you're going to play, especially playing with Brandon Ingram and Lonzo Ball? ZION WILLIAMSON: What excites me the most is the fact that they're young and they're close to my age so they can help me a lot more, like how to deal with this transition.  I think we can build something over there. Q. People have known you for a while because of things like Instagram and stuff like that, but when did you first think that the NBA could be more than a dream and was an actual possibility for you? ZION WILLIAMSON: When the college coaches started coming to my house and telling me that they expect me on campus six to eight months, and then just see me later.  I'm thinking to myself, I don't know about that.  I'll probably be there like two, three, four years, who knows.  And then I met Duke and Coach K, just telling me that I can keep up the hard work, then I can leave after this year.  It's different.  Coach K, top five figure in basketball telling me I can go pro after one year, I mean, what other motivation do you need? Q. You coming to a relatively young team, do you see yourself stepping into more of a leadership role right off the bat because you've been so anticipated as a figure in college and even high school? ZION WILLIAMSON: Yeah, I see myself trying to step into a leadership role.  When I think about doing that, I have to also understand my teammates and understand where their heads are at because I think if you're not on the same page, things don't usually go well.  I think it's a matter of us coming together, making the same goals and just willing to win, and I think we can do something special. Q. What do you believe is the biggest misconception about you going into the league? ZION WILLIAMSON: Gosh, I'm not sure.  I think that I get labeled.  I just get labeled.  I was in a position of hearing about somebody else a lot with like, this player can do this, that, and you want to see for yourself.  So I think with people just trying to label me, I don't think it's that serious because I'm just looking to play basketball and win. Q. What is one attribute that the whole world should know about you? ZION WILLIAMSON: I'm going to do anything to win.  I'm just going to do anything to win. Q. How much have you studied about managing money, having an investment portfolio, not just depending on an agent to do that?  What's your strategy? ZION WILLIAMSON: My strategy is I'm still learning.  I'm going to learn as much as I can about what I need to know.  Any tips, please, shoot them.  I like to hear all kind of advice. Q. You're the first player to be born in the year 2000 to be drafted into the NBA.  You're making history in many ways.  How will you change the league, especially how players relate to younger fans in the future? ZION WILLIAMSON: Before I -- how old are you? Q. I'm 15. ZION WILLIAMSON: I respect that.  I like that. You know, times change.  I think that's why there are so many debates about who people think the greatest players of all time are.  I think if you were in the time of Wilt Chamberlain and Bill Russell, you'd probably say one of those two.  Or if you were in the time of Jordan, you'd say Jordan.  In our generation, a lot of them say LeBron.  So times change, and I think younger fans like younger players. Q. Who are you looking to for advice and counsel on how to handle all the fame and fortune, and what's the best advice you've gotten so far? ZION WILLIAMSON: Just veterans from all teams who have been in the league for like 10-plus years, maybe seven-plus years, because they've usually been through it all by then.  And the best advice I've been given is be myself and keep my love for the game. Q. LeBron James told me he has a lot of advice for you and you know how to reach him.  Did you get to talk to him before the draft?  Will you talk to him?  And what do you want to learn from him and from all the veterans in the league? ZION WILLIAMSON: I actually did see that interview.  Yeah, I probably will hit him up.  Hopefully he responds to me.  My questions would probably be what do I have to do to maintain, what do I have to do to just try to make my way to the top. Q. Everyone saw the moment that you shared on the stage with your mother and the emotional interview.  You said she sacrificed a lot and she means everything to you.  How do you describe your mother for people that don't know her? ZION WILLIAMSON: How would I describe her?  In a lot of words.  Tough love.  She would always be the first one to keep it real with me.  It was never she's trying to cover it up with love.  She would always keep it real with me.  She taught me growing up, and whenever I needed something, she would do everything in her power just to get it for me and my brothers.  She put aside her dreams just so me and my brothers could have a chance at ours.  I don't think a lot of people are fortunate enough to be in that kind of situation, so I just thank God that I got a mother like I did. Q. Reflect on the draft process, doing it with two of your teammates, two of your good friends.  Talk about that process. ZION WILLIAMSON: It makes the process more enjoyable knowing that three of us from the same team are able to get our names called.  We would talk about how we were all born in three different parts of the world and our journeys led us to the same part.  We just found that crazy.  And we wished the best of luck for each other. Q. Have you given thought into being able to play with Cam again potentially in New Orleans? ZION WILLIAMSON: Well, now I have.  Yeah, if Cam came to New Orleans, I can ask him much more.  Cam is a very talented, special player.  I said this at media day yesterday: I wish you were at the scrimmages we had before the season.  I used to look at Cam like, man, this dude is different.  He hit five threes in a row and then come dunk up the middle of the lane.  His ball handling.  That size is just different.  I have a lot of respect for Cam.  If we can get him in New Orleans, I would love that. Q. I moved to New Orleans about 10 years ago, and I think that city is really looking forward to your arrival, and I think you're going to enjoy it.  It's a city like no other with so much going on culturally.  I wanted to take the focus off basketball for one second since music plays such a big part and ask you, do you have a favorite brass instrument? ZION WILLIAMSON: Do I have a favorite brass instrument?  Wow.  Wow, that's a great question.  I'm not sure.  I'm not sure.  That's a great question. Q. I know one of the exciting parts about getting ready for the draft is finding out what to wear.  How exciting was that for you as far as fashion? ZION WILLIAMSON: I just trusted Adrien [Sauvage] with this suit.  He said your skin will pop in this color.  I was like, I don't know about that.  But he's been in the fashion business for a long time and he trusts my game, so I was like, all right, I guess we'll do the cream white suit.  And when I saw it in person, I was like, you know what, I actually might look good.\"}, 'Coby White': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=151232', 'text': \"Q. Could you talk about your style and what you'll bring to your new team? COBY WHITE: Leadership, fast pace, can get up and down the court, can score the ball in a variety of ways, get my teammates involved.  Just a competitor and a player who has the will to win. Q. This is the first time you'll be heading out of state on a permanent basis.  Any thoughts about going to the city of Chicago, big town, gets a little cold there in the winter?  Any thoughts on the city? COBY WHITE: Yeah, it's a great city.  They have a great fan base.  I'm excited.  This is my first time -- it's a change, but it's a great change.  It's going to be an adjustment. I'm excited.  It should be great. Q. Somebody else from North Carolina had a great career in Chicago.  I was wondering if you might have been in touch with him sometime.  Have you been in touch with him and will you be in touch with him to ask him about Chicago? COBY WHITE: I don't know.  I can't tell you that right now.  But I've seen him on campus a couple times.  I haven't really got a chance to really sit down and talk to him. Q. When your name was announced and you're walking to the podium, what's going through your head? COBY WHITE: Don't trip.  Don't trip.  You get a rush of feelings and emotions that I feel like that you really can't describe.  You worked so hard for this your whole life, and when you're finally here, you know it's a relief for sure. Q. Given you grew up in North Carolina, are you going to go back to get your degree at Chapel Hill? COBY WHITE: Yeah, I'm definitely going to go back and finish.  I promised my mom, Coach Williams and myself that I would go back and get my degree. Q. What do you want to study? COBY WHITE: I'm not sure yet.  It's between exercise science and sports management, but those two can change at any time.  You know how majors are. Q. You wrote a really touching piece in the Players' Tribune.  Obviously writing that must have been so much of an emotional roller coaster.  I'm sure he was on your mind all night as you were walking to the podium.  Talk to us about that. A. Yeah, he's been on my mind all day.  It's hard for me right now.  I'm excited, but it's also hard for me because I would give anything to have him here with me tonight and let him see me walk across the stage.  But you know, I've just got to enjoy the moment.  My family is here.  A lot of people came to see me.  It's great from that aspect.  I have such a supporting base.  Just got to keep moving. Q. Cameron Johnson just went 11th.  How do you react to that news? COBY WHITE: Cam went 11th? Q. Yeah, it's right on the screen right there. COBY WHITE: Wow.  Wow.  Wow, bro!  That's crazy.  That's so low, bro.  Y'all know Cam?  You don't know how hard Cam worked.  There's a lot of people that doubt him.  But wow, that's crazy, bro.  Wow, that's so crazy.  I'm so happy for him right now.  Y'all don't understand how happy I am for Cam.  He proved it night in, night out that he deserves to be in the conversation for a lottery pick, man.  He shot the ball like anybody I've never seen before in my life or played with.  Wow.  I'm getting chills up here.\"}, 'PJ Washington, Jr.': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=151240', 'text': \"Q. Talk about what you'll bring to your new team. PJ WASHINGTON: A lot of emotions right now.  Just excited.  Can't wait to get to Charlotte, show what I can do.  I'm a very versatile player.  Great locker room guy. Just willing to give anything for my teammates. Q. I know Coach Calipari is a pretty sharp businessman as well as being a great basketball coach.  Did he give you business advice about choosing an agent or making sure you stay in Nevada so you don't have to pay any state income tax? PJ WASHINGTON: No, he hasn't. Q. What financial advice have you gotten in this process? PJ WASHINGTON: Basically what you said: Stay in Vegas.  I picked a great agency and I have a good financial advisor.  So pretty much just listening to them.  I think they'll lead me in the right path. Q. Was it like Jerry Maguire?  How much of it was reality versus fantasy? PJ WASHINGTON: It's crazy.  I feel like I'm with a great group.  Excited to be with them and just happy they took me along with the group as well. Q. How did Coach Calipari prepare you for fulfilling your NBA dream? PJ WASHINGTON: He prepared me a lot from day one, ever since I stepped on Kentucky.  He's been a great leader for the program.  He built everybody up to be a pro.  Just did a lot for me and my family.  I just can't thank him enough. Q. You played in the UK so you have lots of Chinese fans.  Do you want to say something to the Chinese fans? PJ WASHINGTON: Keep supporting UK.  Thanks for always supporting me. Q. Can you cite a drill that Coach Calipari put you guys through that you're going to be glad you don't have to do anymore? PJ WASHINGTON: Not necessarily a drill, but whenever you weren't practicing good, he would just send you over to the treadmill right away.  You just had to give him like a minute or two minutes running as fast as you can.  So definitely you used to always just go hard in practice.  Didn't want to do that. Q. What's going through your head as you're walking to the podium? PJ WASHINGTON: Just a lot of excitement.  Can't thank God enough.  Excited for me and my family.  I can't thank them enough.  I can't thank my coach enough.  Just blessed to be in this position. Q. You expanded your shot a little bit this season, took a lot more shots from three.  Moving into the NBA, is there a particular skill or part of your game that you're going to look to implement a little bit more that we didn't get to see at Kentucky? PJ WASHINGTON: I feel like I can improve my ball handling.  That's one area I feel like I was a little shaky.  I'm going to improve on that and feel like I can come in and make an impact as well.\"}, 'Matisse Thybulle': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=151248', 'text': \"Q. Can you describe this experience so far, your feelings, how the night is going? MATISSE THYBULLE: It's been surreal.  I think it's going to take a little bit for me to realize it's actually happened.  But yeah, I'm just trying to take it all in. Q. Just your thoughts on going to the Sixers? MATISSE THYBULLE: A dream come true.  I haven't gotten to spend much time in Philly, but I've heard nothing but good things.  I've got family nearby, so I can't wait to play for this franchise and be a part of their new family.  I've got family in Jersey, so not too far. Q. You're a two-time Pac-12 defensive Player of the Year.  Why do you take so much pride in what you're able to do on that side of the floor? MATISSE THYBULLE: There's always a place for a defender on the court.  Defense has proved to help you win games and win championships.  I feel like to be as valuable as possible to a team, I feel like I need to be a defender.  And then added to that, in the NBA you need to be able to shoot threes at a high rate.  So I bring that to the table as well. Q. When did you first hear about the trade and all the craziness of it?  Can you describe that? MATISSE THYBULLE: Before they called my name, my agent leaned over to me and whispered and told me that I was going to get drafted by the Celtics but I was still going to Philly.  So I wasn't going to have to worry about that.  It was nice knowing that going into it so I didn't have to be surprised by the Celtics pick. Q. What did you do with the hat? MATISSE THYBULLE: I'm not sure where the hat is.  I think I have a new hat coming, though.  Yeah. Q. You're always described as a defensive player.  Can you talk about your offensive game and how you think that's evolved? MATISSE THYBULLE: Like I mentioned earlier, I feel like three-point shooting -- just being three-and-D, I feel like that's a role I can fit into off the bat.  I took a step back in college and allowed some of my teammates to score, and that shows with my offensive numbers.  But three-point shooting is something that's come naturally to me, and I'm just excited to be able to do it at this next level. Q. You're going to a Sixers team that came really, really close to knocking off a team that ended up winning a title.  How does it feel to know from day one you're going to be on a team that really has championship aspirations? MATISSE THYBULLE: Through the whole process, I was always telling my friends and family I want to play for a good team because I feel like my skill set is the most valuable when it comes to a team that's already established and they have guys with roles and I know my role.  I know I can just step into that role and help this team. Q. I know you said you have family from Jersey.  Markelle Fultz played for the Sixers briefly.  Did you pay attention to the Sixers because he's a former teammate of yours, because of that connection? MATISSE THYBULLE: Yeah, I've watched the Sixers.  Just being a basketball fan, watching basketball, I've watched them because you want to watch the good teams.  So of course I've watched them. Q. Even though they're a veteran team, there are still a lot of guys they have to sign.  Do you feel like you can come in and contribute right away? MATISSE THYBULLE: Yeah, without a doubt.  I feel like that was one of the reasons why I stayed in college all four years was just so I could be as ready as possible when I came to the next level.\"}, 'Deividas Sirvydis': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=151259', 'text': \"Q. Describe your style of play and what you'll bring to your new team? DEIVIDAS SIRVYDIS: I think I'm a great shooter, so I can be at the perimeter.  I can play with the ball, play some pick-and-rolls.  I'm not a bad passer.  But the thing for me, I think, is shooting. Q. Can you talk about continuing the line long of great Lithuanian players to play in the league, starting with Sarunas Marciulionis and on and on? DEIVIDAS SIRVYDIS: I hope so. Q. Could you tell us which NBA basketball players, if any, you idolized as a kid? DEIVIDAS SIRVYDIS: Everybody is like Michael Jordan and other legends, but when I was a little kid, I was watching my dad.  He was a pro basketball player, so I was watching him.  I wanted to be like him. Q. What is it about watching him play when you were younger that kind of brought you on this path toward basketball? DEIVIDAS SIRVYDIS: I think that the biggest thing that I took from him is shooting.  He was a great shooter, too.  I traveled with him around the world when he played in other countries, so the whole living with him in other countries made me like feel a better basketball player and a better man off the court. Q. What would you say to the younger kids who want to play in the NBA and follow in your footsteps? DEIVIDAS SIRVYDIS: The first thing I think, it should be a good coach, a good place to play basketball to improve yourself.  And second thing is family and friends who can stay with you in the tough moments and help you in those tough moments to get through.\"}, 'Luka Samanic': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=151249', 'text': \"Q. Just describe your style of play, what you'll bring to your new team. LUKA SAMANIC: I think I'm a big guy.  I can run the floor, play defense, switch from 1 to 5, shoot the ball.  I think that's really important.  And spread the floor for the guards. Q. What's going through your head when you're walking to the podium? LUKA SAMANIC: I was speechless, nervous, excited, everything in one.  I'm just blessed to be part of San Antonio.  I'm happy and ready to go. Q. Can you tell us what you know about the San Antonio Spurs?  Have you watched them play much? LUKA SAMANIC: Yeah, I think they have a really similar basketball style to Europe and they have a long history with European players.  That's one more motive for me to just go there and try to be ready as much as possible and just to play. Q. If I can build off of that last question, specifically Coach Gregg Popovich, one of the most well-known and accomplished coaches in the NBA, also famously one of the most demanding.  I'm wondering what thoughts you have about going to work with him and his team of player development coaches. LUKA SAMANIC: I think working with Coach Pop, it's different.  I'm just really excited to start and just to learn from him and from other players older than me.  I'm ready. Q. How was your workout with San Antonio ahead of the draft?  What stood out for you?  What stood out in your eyes about the organization as well? LUKA SAMANIC: It was my first workout with an NBA team.  It was difficult.  We played a lot of one-on-one and three-on-three, and a lot of shooting, too.  And interviews.  They care about how you are off court, too, so you have to be the whole package.  I'm just blessed. Q. For those who are trying to learn a little bit more about your game, who would you compare yourself to in terms of another player? LUKA SAMANIC: Right now I think KD.  A big guy who can shoot, who can play facing the basket, low post.  But all the time, maybe [Andrei] Kirilenko.  He played in Utah.  I can run and jump and play defense.  Just whatever it takes. Q. Who are some of the guys, basketball players, some of the role models you had?  And what did you know about the Spurs before meeting up with them, interviewing, working out with them? LUKA SAMANIC: Yeah, my idols -- Toni Kukoc.  He's Croatian.  Drazen Petrovic, too.  Then right now, KD.  Just all the big guys.  Dragan Bender. With the Spurs, I knew they had a winning mentality.  They want to win.  They want to compete.  They're a great organization.  And like I said, they're connected with Europeans. Q. I was interested when you mentioned that the interview process in San Antonio included questions about off-court matters.  Could you tell us or share with us one of the questions they asked about you that went outside of the actual basketball court? LUKA SAMANIC: Yeah, it's how I am with my family, how I am with my friends, teammates.  That's on court but also off court.  What I like to do in my free time.  How I am in school. Q. What do you like to do in your free time? LUKA SAMANIC: Hanging out with my friends.  Spend time with my family.  Music, movies.  Simple. Q. Your dad, Marko, was probably your first coach.  When did it dawn in his mind, in your mind, that being in the NBA could be a possibility? LUKA SAMANIC: First of all, my father was always not just a basketball coach.  I think more [I learned] of how to be a good person.  He never really pushed me; [it wasn't] you have to play basketball because he played.  I think it was just my choice.  He was more [stressing to] be a good teammate, be a good person, be good in school. I think the idea of the NBA started when I moved to Barcelona from Croatia for the first time.  I was 16.  It was just an idea.  I had this dream since I started. Q. San Antonio is known big for Mexican food, known big for the heat and humidity.  Do you like either of those two? LUKA SAMANIC: Yeah, I like Mexican food.  And humidity is okay.\"}, 'Cam Reddish': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=151241', 'text': \"Q.

Was around him a lot throughout this entire process.  I'm definitely looking forward to playing with him. Q. De'Andre said he knew you when he was in the 10th grade.  What has been your relationship with him throughout these years? CAM REDDISH: Yeah, our high schools were in the same league.  So we grew up kind of playing against each other a little bit.  We know each other just enough.  I'm looking forward to getting to know him a little bit more.  Getting ready to get to work. Q. You mentioned yesterday how playing alongside Trae would be a good thing for you.  What did you mean by that?  How can he elevate your game? CAM REDDISH: Yeah, I think he's a great leader, a tremendous work ethic.  I think he can do it all on the court.  Obviously he's a tremendous passer.  Will be able to find me throughout the entire game.  I'm looking forward to learning from him, being around him, soaking it all in. Q. What does it say about the Philadelphia area to have two guys picked in the top 10? CAM REDDISH: Yeah, Philly is a basketball city, for sure.  I'm from Norristown, Pennsylvania, which is also a basketball city.  It's crazy, really.  It's crazy. Q. Zion was very complimentary to you in his press conference.

I'm happy for him.  I hope he does great things.  I know he will do great things.  I'll for sure be watching. Q. I want to know what aspects of your game you think you got to improve in order to get to the next level once you get to the NBA? CAM REDDISH: I feel like I have to improve on my consistency.  Get my body right.  Get healthy.  Get in the weight room.  Trying to stay healthy throughout the entire season. I think it all starts with my diet.  But just being healthy. Q. What was it like watching from beginning to end?  What were your emotions as you were waiting for your name to be picked?  What was going through your head? CAM REDDISH: Yeah, I mean, Zion was the No. 1 pick.  I was ecstatic.  I'm so happy to see him make his dream come true.  RJ, No. 3.  My emotions were just going all over the place.  Super excited for those guys.  Obviously, I was taken No. 10 by Atlanta.  That's really a dream come true, truly a blessing.  I'm just happy to be here. Q. Was it a grind waiting there? CAM REDDISH: It was definitely a grind.  Minutes felt like hours.  Felt like it took forever. Q. You talked about the Philly connection.  What about the three Duke guys in the top 10?  What does it say about the program and just where you are as friends? CAM REDDISH: Yeah, Duke is truly a brotherhood.  What you guys see from the outside, it's real.  To see those guys get drafted means a lot to me.  I know it means a lot to them.  It's truly a blessing. Q. When there was that possibility of reuniting with Zion in the NBA, did anything go through your mind then?  What emotions were you thinking of? CAM REDDISH: I mean, for sure.  Playing with Zion, it was a ton of fun this year.  I would never pass that up.  I really didn't think too much about it.  But it would have definitely been great. Q. What do you think about being a part of this young core in Atlanta? CAM REDDISH: It's a young, talented group.  I'm just trying to come in and be the best addition I can possibly be to that team.  Just giving my all every single day.  Try to improve, progress every single day. Q. Is there one or a few favorite Coach K quotes that you carried until today that motivate you, some of the things that he said that left a great memory for you until today? CAM REDDISH: Yeah, I remember during the Louisville game, during halftime, he told us he doesn't coach losers.  That stuck with me.

I feel like I've got a lot of work to do, but I can bring a lot of things to the team. Q. Just regarding your jacket, what has your dad meant to you on your journey to this moment, and what are you thinking about him tonight? KEVIN PORTER JR.: My dad has been there since day one, the start of my journey.  So he means everything, the world to me.  I wish he could be here, of course, but I know he's smiling and everything.  I love him to death and he loves me to death. Q. Can you just talk about how exciting it is for you to play with Giannis and how your game complements his? KEVIN PORTER JR.: Well, I just heard I might be going to the Cavs.  But if it stays, definitely it would be a blessing.  He's an MVP candidate.  Just to have that on a mentor level is a blessing.  Being able to play with somebody like that, you can definitely learn from them. Q. If it is Cleveland, then what do you foresee your role being there? KEVIN PORTER JR.: I see my role coming in just playing really -- it's just a young team, and they're in the development stages.  I feel like I'll fit right in. Q. I can't help but ask, coming out of USC in a year that the college was really rocked by scandal about college admissions and students getting in who were supposedly athletes who turned out not to be athletes and here you are an actual athlete.  Did that cross your radar or that of your teammates, that drama? KEVIN PORTER JR.: No.  We were always out of it.  The basketball team, we were doing stuff the right way.  We were never in any of that admissions stuff.\"}, 'Jordan Poole': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=151256', 'text': 'Q. Can you just talk about your style of play and what you\\'ll bring to the new team? JORDAN POOLE: Being able to shoot the three is a strength of mine, but also being able to be a 6\\'5\" guard who can play on the ball, off the ball.  Being able to make the right decisions but also just knowing how to play the game the right way.  Make the right passes and make the next right play is something that I feel like I\\'m able to contribute to the team. Q. Obviously we\\'ve watched a lot of Warriors the last few years.  You too?  If so, what are your impressions and how can you contribute there? JORDAN POOLE: Yeah, the Warriors are an amazing team.  One of their strengths is their ability to shoot the three ball.  I feel like that\\'s something that\\'s changed the game.  Being able to shoot the three is a strength of mine.  Finding a way to come in and make an impact and being able just to learn from the guys is something that I\\'m definitely extremely excited for. Q. There was a pretty loud contingent of people at Michigan that criticized you for leaving when you did.  Now having been picked in the first round, your response to them? JORDAN POOLE: I think it was just being able just to trust myself, follow my dreams. Just having hope and faith.  That\\'s all I\\'m going to really say on that.  Being able to be in the position I\\'m in now, I feel like I made the right decision. Q. What do you think it\\'s going to be like, that moment that you step on the floor in San Francisco, you look over, you\\'ve got Stephen Curry to your right?  What do you think that moment is going to be like? JORDAN POOLE: It\\'ll definitely be amazing.  Being able to know at the same time we\\'re out there doing the same thing, and they\\'re definitely going to teach me some stuff right away and they\\'re definitely going to invite me into the league.  Being ready for all challenges, but more than anything just coming in ready to get to work and be excited.'}, 'Ja Morant': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=151229', 'text': \"Q. How would you summarize your experience so far tonight? JA MORANT: It's been crazy.  Obviously a wild moment for me, coming from my story, what I've been through to get to this point.  I'm just very excited to be able to accomplish my dream. Q. You've played it pretty close to the vest up until now on your feelings where you wanted to go, if anywhere.  Now that you're wearing that Memphis hat, what do you think of Memphis?  How does it feel to finally hear your name called? JA MORANT: It means a lot.  Obviously it means that Memphis sees a lot in me.  I'm grateful and thankful to them for drafting me.  I'm very excited to play in Memphis. Q. You talked a lot about Damian Lillard, some of the other mid-major players that inspired you.  How do you feel about falling into that lineage as someone that other mid-major kids are going to look at as inspiration? JA MORANT: Like you said, like Dame, CJ [McCollum], [Stephen] Curry, [Pascal] Siakam, [Fred] VanVleet.  We can go down the line of mid-major players who made a name for themselves in this league.  I feel like guys who opened the door for me, it's only right that I go in, try to do what those guys did, make a name and keep the doors open for other mid-major players.  It just means a lot for them to look up to me. Q. What has the process been like for you?  Obviously you just got drafted.  You had a meeting with the Grizzlies recently.  What has that initial message been like to you as far as expectations for next season? JA MORANT: Obviously I think it went good.  I got to know them, they got to know me.  It's just an honor to be able to play for Memphis. Q. During the pre-draft process, were you ever tired?  Were you able to enjoy it?  Were you able to enjoy tonight?  Was it just overwhelming at some point? JA MORANT: No, I had to enjoy the whole process.  Obviously my first time going through it.  Who would have thought I would have been in this position right here three, four years ago?  I have the opportunity to do it now.  The process was very exciting.  I'm just happy. Q. What did it mean kind of seeing the Grizzlies move yesterday, making room for you, to really take hold of this franchise? JA MORANT: I have some big shoes to fill in Mike Conley.  He's a great player.  I wish him the best.  Like I said before, it just means the Grizzlies see a lot in me. Q. Have you had any communication with Jaren Jackson at all during this process? JA MORANT: Me and Jaren have been talking for a while.  We had a strong relationship before the process started.  It was just mainly him congratulating me on everything that I've accomplished.  Now I have the opportunity to play with Jaren, so ... Q. This draft class is always going to be linked together.  What do you think you guys collectively bring to the league? JA MORANT: A lot of excitement.  I feel like it's a lot of talented guys in this draft class.  You don't know who's going where, to what team.  I do feel like we will bring excitement to this league. Q. What was the feeling like tonight, to be drafted in this environment, to kind of see where your future is headed? JA MORANT: It was very exciting and emotional.  I'm trying not to get emotional now.  It's just an honor to be in this position that I'm in right now.  I'm happy for it. Q. Now that you know where you're going, what's the next step for you?  What do you do to prepare heading into the summer, into training camp next fall? JA MORANT: I'm just going to continue to try to be the best Ja on and off the court.  Try to come in, do whatever I can to help this team win games.  Also try to come in and make a name for myself and an impact on the Memphis Grizzlies. Q. What was your dad's first reaction? JA MORANT: He definitely was happy.  But knowing him, once I get back, get to see him, he'll probably say I still haven't done anything yet.  Just to continue to push me to be the best Ja I can be. Q. Congrats on the Nike deal.  Would you share us what that brand means to you, and some of the positive takeaways about this sponsorship deal, this endorsement? JA MORANT: It means a lot to me.  Actually growing up, I always wanted a pair of Nikes.  Now I have the chance to work with them.  Like I said, it's a wild moment for me, to be able to be part of Nike.\"}, 'Marcos Louzada Silva': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=151261', 'text': \"Q. How would you describe your style of play? MARCOS LOUZADA SILVA: The best part of my game is defense.  I like to play on both sides of the floor. My shooting has improved really well. Q. (No microphone). MARCOS LOUZADA SILVA: I'm grateful to be able to play at the national team.  I also played with [Leandro] Barbosa and Anderson Varejao, who also played in the NBA.  So I got a lot of experience of playing with these guys playing at a high level at a young age. Q. What is your feeling about getting picked?  You're the 14th Brazilian guy that got drafted. MARCOS LOUZADA SILVA: I'm speechless.  I speak for my family, especially for my grandmother that passed away a couple months ago.  I'm really happy because my mother is here with me in the USA for the first time.  So I'm really happy.\"}, 'Nassir Little': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=151252', 'text': 'Q. Could you just describe your style of play and what you\\'ll bring to your new team? NASSIR LITTLE: I\\'m an athletic and versatile wing.  I can do a lot of different things. Really good defensively.  Be around the ball.  Able to hit open shots and finish inside the paint well. Q. You were out there for a while.  What were the emotions of watching all the picks go by? NASSIR LITTLE: Just anxious, anticipation.  Just wanting to feel that feeling of excitement when your name is called.  It was definitely worth it, man.  So I\\'m glad to be here. Q. How did you first learn where you were going? NASSIR LITTLE: They usually contact your agent and they\\'ll let you know.  Yeah, that\\'s kind of how it went.  And then the Commissioner confirms it. Q. So your agent leans over and whispers, \"You\\'re going here\"? NASSIR LITTLE: Yeah, yeah. Q. How was that moment? NASSIR LITTLE: That moment was cool, but the moment when the Commissioner comes out and really says your name is the real boom.  That\\'s when the real emotions start to come out.  I was glad to experience that. Q. As you were going through the draft process, what were you told was your projected range to be picked? NASSIR LITTLE: Projected range was in the lottery. Q. And how do you respond to the teams that passed on you that were in the lottery? NASSIR LITTLE: I play basketball.  No matter what, I\\'ve got to play, regardless of where you\\'re picked.  So just continue to do what I\\'ve always been doing. Q. If you could identify something that you learned in terms of your basketball game or otherwise while you were in college at North Carolina, could you pick one area where you feel you really developed in this last year? NASSIR LITTLE: I think I developed most probably my off-the-ball defense, being introduced to new defensive schemes and stuff like that.  I think I really took strides in understanding that part of the game. Q. Could you try to convey a drill or some kind of notes you got in practice that helped you improve off-ball defense? NASSIR LITTLE: Not necessarily a drill, but just watching film with the assistant coaches and just kind of seeing where I was supposed to be on the court, and then trying to implement it in practice and games. Q. What is it like sharing this night with Coby and Cam? NASSIR LITTLE: It\\'s special, man.  We\\'ve had hundreds of practices together, and we all worked so hard to get to this moment.  I think we all beat a lot of odds to get here.  So just kind of seeing us all go through this has been really exciting.  I\\'m happy for all three of us. Q. What do you know about the Trail Blazers and how do you think you\\'ll fit in? NASSIR LITTLE: Yeah, I watched them play a lot.  They\\'ve got two great guards in Damian Lillard and CJ McCollum.  I think at the 3 position they could use some more talent, and I think I provide that for them.  I think me playing with great guards like that can also help me develop as a good player.'}, 'Romeo Langford': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=151246', 'text': \"Q. If you could just describe your style of play and what you'll bring to the Celtics. ROMEO LANGFORD: I see myself as just real smooth.  I think I'm a real versatile player.  I feel I can play multiple positions.  I can do a lot.  Whatever the team needs to be done. Q. 40 years ago the Boston Celtics drafted this other guy from Indiana, Larry Bird.  I was curious if that kind of went through your mind when your name was called by them. ROMEO LANGFORD: Really just a sigh of relief.  Just really thankful and blessed to be able to picked at the No. 14 spot and also by the Boston Celtics. Q. Are you familiar with Bird's career?  He's an Indiana legend who played in Boston. ROMEO LANGFORD: Yeah.  I never really watched him play, but I am familiar with Larry Bird.  Yes, sir. Q. You spoke yesterday about not really working out for teams.  Were you at all ever concerned about how that might impact your kind of status, and how did you convince teams, look at my body of work? ROMEO LANGFORD: I felt like that had a little bit to do with it. But I felt like I've showcased a lot playing at Indiana, also, my time in high school.  These guys, they know what I'm capable of doing.  I think that's why the Boston Celtics saw something in me and I think that's why they decided to pick me at the 14 spot. Q. What do you know about the Celtics, about kind of the way they run things as a franchise and about the team?  Obviously there are some changes coming there, and how do you feel like you might fit in? ROMEO LANGFORD: It's a really, really good, historic organization.  They're coming off a real good year.  Making it to the playoffs and doing well in the playoffs.  I just feel like the team that they have, everybody is real versatile.  It's like they really play positionless basketball.  That's what I excel at. Q. Your shooting numbers, you struggled a little bit and it was reported that you had a little bit of a problem with your thumb.  Where are you at with that, and do you see your shooting improving as that gets better into next year? ROMEO LANGFORD: Yeah, I hurt my thumb this year.  I felt like that did have a little bit of reason why I shot the ball the way I did.  But right now I'm getting back into the swing of things.  Got my cast off.  I'm doing some rehab and therapy.\"}, 'Mfiondu Kabengele': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=151257', 'text': 'Q. If you\\'d just talk about your style of play and what you\\'ll bring to your new team? MFIONDU KABENGELE: I bring a lot of energy.  I bring a lot of poise and technique.  I feel like my game is very polished.  Obviously there\\'s room to grow, but my body and the way I can improve and the growth and potential that I have, I\\'m very excited for the future.  So that kind of mental strength and ability I feel like I\\'m going to bring to any team I go to. Q. The hat says Brooklyn, the watch they gave you says Brooklyn, but we know it\\'s not going to be Brooklyn.  What do you think about going to Los Angeles and playing for the Clippers? MFIONDU KABENGELE: You know, when you\\'re from Canada, God hasn\\'t blessed me a lot with great weather.  So I went to Tallahassee.  That was a great time.  And now I\\'m off to Los Angeles and join Doc Rivers and his crew and see how they compete on a daily basis, as well as in the playoffs.  I\\'m super excited to be part of that culture.  When I get there, I\\'m going to bring a lot of energy and just go for it. Q. Do you know Shai pretty well? MFIONDU KABENGELE: I know of him, but we went to different prep schools and we never really got tight like that.  But I\\'m excited to get to know him even more. Q. I noticed you said \"poise\" was the first thing you said.  Is this something you\\'ve consciously worked on, and if so, how? MFIONDU KABENGELE: Yeah, growing up I faced a lot of adversity.  Not getting recruited highly, redshirting, coming off the bench.  I feel like that takes a lot of mental strength.  Being a part of it strengthens you.  And I feel like I\\'ve handled it with grace and poise as well.  So I feel at the next level any challenge I will face, I am ready for it and ready to compete and excel from it. Q. Could you talk a little bit about your uncle [Dikembe Mutombo] and the exchanges you\\'ve had with him? MFIONDU KABENGELE: Yeah, it\\'s been great.  Growing up, it\\'s always been about family.  He\\'s always flown us out to family events, graduations, Christmas, Thanksgiving.  So when basketball started to get involved, it was probably going to my freshman year, my Elite Eight run.  Just picking his brain and asking him a lot of questions.  And by me doing that, I think he recognized that I was very interested and poised about the game and the next level.  So that\\'s when it grew to picking his brain about how to eat, the nutrition, the day-to-day, challenges you would face off the court and on the court.  He\\'s given me so many gems that I\\'m going to add to my life, especially in Los Angeles and even though it\\'s a bit further from home.  All those lessons I\\'m going to carry with me.  So I\\'m very thankful for him. Q. You talked about growing up playing basketball at a high school level in Canada.  You became the fourth Canadian player taken in this first round, which is a new record for Canadian basketball players in a single NBA Draft.  Looking at this year\\'s draft with four of you guys being taken in the first round and the amount of Canadian players that have been taken in the past few years, you\\'ve talked about Shai going to be your teammate there in LA, as well, how have you seen that development and growth of the Canadian basketball scene over the past few seasons? MFIONDU KABENGELE: It\\'s been growing steadily with the pioneers in Steve Nash; we have [Andrew] Wiggins, Tyler Ennis.  I feel like other Canadian kids like myself are inspired.  We took our training much more seriously.  The game has globalized more where there is more cohesion, especially in AAU basketball.  That\\'s why I feel the Canadian game has been growing, just because of the overall growth and just constant competition, especially in the United States.  I feel like in this next group of kids who have watched me, the same way I\\'ve watched others, it\\'s just going to grow from there. Q. What would be your message to a young Canadian kid right now watching on TV?  How would you want him to view you? MFIONDU KABENGELE: There\\'s so much good advice, but the one thing that\\'s always stuck with me the most would be success is only temporary and failure is not permanent.  I made a lot of mistakes.  Being overlooked.  I felt like I made a lot of errors, and I had a long route rather than others.  But I recognized from the jump at a young age that this is not permanent.  There\\'s always a brighter side, especially going through this whole draft process.  You\\'re waiting your turn and you\\'re recognizing, oh you think you\\'re better than this guy or that guy, but you know your time is your time.  Whatever I\\'m going through, whatever I\\'m feeling is not permanent.  Whatever I do get and whatever I do achieve, it\\'s only temporary. So whatever kid is watching me right now, you must continue to work and just fight for what you have because it is very difficult to get to this level.  But it\\'s completely worth it.'}, 'Keldon Johnson': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=151255', 'text': \"Q.

I feel like I'm very versatile, play multiple positions.  I think I fit pretty well. Q. This time last year you were getting selected to college at the University of Kentucky.  I have heard Coach Cal say so the NBA is a man's league.  How tough do you expect that transition to be? KELDON JOHNSON: I think it will be pretty tough.  I think I adjust pretty well.  I think my game really translates to the NBA.  So I think I'll be fine.  I'll just listen to my coach and get ready to learn. Q. Yesterday we spoke a little bit about your pre-draft meeting with San Antonio.  One thing you told me that stood out was they told you they can develop your game.  How do you see your game meshing with guys like DeMar Derozan, LaMarcus Aldridge and Dejounte Murray? KELDON JOHNSON: I feel I could play well with any players.  I feel I'm not hard to play with.  I feel I am very versatile.  That's one thing I take pride in is I bring a lot of energy and I'm hard-working. So I think that we'll get with them and we'll sit down, and definitely I think that it's one of the best programs in the world with developing players' games.  Get down there and work with player development and get ready for the grind. Q. You're coming from an environment where Kentucky is literally all of Lexington.  San Antonio is very similar in that the Spurs essentially are San Antonio.  How cool is that for you knowing that you're going to somewhat of a similar environment where essentially the entire town just bleeds that silver and black passion? KELDON JOHNSON: I'm used to it.  I feel like at Kentucky, like you said, in Lexington, it's the University of Kentucky.  So going into here, I'm very excited.  I'm ready to learn and work.

I\\'m just happy that I got picked pretty early. Q. You said on TV you only worked out for the Hawks.  Did you have an inclination this was going to happen? DE\\'ANDRE HUNTER: I didn\\'t know they were going to trade up to the fourth pick.  I know they were trying to do something to get earlier in the draft.  I mean, it was just a decision between me and my agents.  Atlanta was the one place I did work out for. Q. Is it weird to have that Lakers hat up there when you know you\\'re going to the Hawks? DE\\'ANDRE HUNTER: Yeah, it\\'s a little weird.  I don\\'t have any problem wearing the hat. Q. What does it mean to you, the Hawks gave up all that capital to move up because they had their eye on you from the beginning? DE\\'ANDRE HUNTER: It shows that they believe in me, that they have trust in me.  They have a plan for me as well.  They think I\\'m a great player.  I\\'m just hoping to help the franchise any way I can. Q. Did you get any word before the draft this was happening?  News broke about an hour before.  Did you know much before? DE\\'ANDRE HUNTER: Yeah, actually Kyle Guy texted me.  He said, \"Yeah!\" I was like, \"What are you talking about?\" He said, \"The Hawks traded up to four.\" I was pretty happy about that. Q. What do you know about the Hawks?  What do you think you can bring to them when you get to Atlanta? DE\\'ANDRE HUNTER: I think they have a great young nucleus.  They have great coaching.  Trae Young is a great player.  Kevin Huerter.  John Collins.  Those are all great young players.  I feel like I can come in, provide a defensive spark, score a little bit on the offensive end and do the things needed to win. Q. I imagine this is something you\\'ve been envisioning for quite some time.  What was going through your head when you finally heard your name called? DE\\'ANDRE HUNTER: I mean, my heart was beating in my chest.  I was so nervous.  Once I heard my name called, it\\'s hard to explain.  I just wanted to hug my family. I wanted to share the moment with them. Q. What are you feeling now about your friends in Philly, how happy they are for you, your time in Philly, what that meant not only to you but to them? DE\\'ANDRE HUNTER: It\\'s amazing.  I\\'m straight out of Philly.  I represent.  I just want to be a motivation for the kids, the younger people that look up to me, want to try to do the same thing I\\'m doing.  I\\'m just trying to be motivation for them. Q. What is the significance of your necklace and who is on it? DE\\'ANDRE HUNTER: Yeah, it\\'s a picture of me and my dad when I was a baby.  I was about eight months maybe.  My dad passed away when I was in first grade.  I just want him to be here with me.  I want him to get drafted with me.  He\\'s seeing everything I\\'m seeing right now.  So he\\'s right here with me. Q. You\\'ve already had one teammate, Trae Young, tweet out he\\'s ready to go to work with you.  What is it like having that support already with your teammates? DE\\'ANDRE HUNTER: That\\'s great.  That\\'s coming from the Rookie of the Year possibly.  He\\'s a great player.  The fact he\\'s excited to work with me just makes me excited to be there, to get the ability to be able to work with them. Q. What was your dad\\'s name?  I understand he was drafted, as well.  What was that situation? DE\\'ANDRE HUNTER: No, he wasn\\'t drafted.  Not to my knowledge, no. His name was Aaron, though.  Yeah (smiling). Q. You talked a lot about the Hawks.  You got a Lakers hat up there.  Any special plans for it?  Put it in the closet and save it as a memento from tonight? DE\\'ANDRE HUNTER: I don\\'t necessarily know what I\\'m going to do with it.  Probably give it to a Lakers fan.  Have them wear it. Q. Obviously, have you been communicating with Kyle and Ty [Jerome] throughout the day? DE\\'ANDRE HUNTER: Yeah, we texted right before the draft.  Ran a group message.  We were telling each other how excited we were for each other.  We\\'ve been waiting for this moment for our entire lives.  It was a goal we set out since our freshman year.  I can\\'t wait to see their names get called. Q. How do you feel your experience over the last two years, going from the lows to the highs, will benefit you going into the NBA? DE\\'ANDRE HUNTER: I feel like I\\'ve been through it all kind of in a sense, from redshirting, to the next year not playing as much, not playing great, not getting a lot of minutes really, to getting hurt again in the tournament, losing like that in the tournament.  It taught me a lot. I felt like it really matured me as a player. Off the court as well. Q. What are some of the moves or skills that you are looking forward to adding to your arsenal over the summer before the league starts? DE\\'ANDRE HUNTER: Just being a great shooter.  Working on my shooting.  Working on creating off the dribble.  Those are things I\\'ve really been focusing on.  Trying to keep everything good as well -- my rebounding, my defensive ability, trying to be an all-around player. Q. How does it feel to have Jaxson Hayes as a teammate? DE\\'ANDRE HUNTER: Yeah, it\\'s great.  I\\'ve been talking to him a little bit when he was here.  He\\'s a great dude.  I saw him at Texas a few times.  He\\'s a great player.  Can really protect the rim.  Having a great young guy like that will be really good for us and the team. Q. Do you feel the team can rebuild around you two young guys, get going right away? DE\\'ANDRE HUNTER: I mean, possibly.  That\\'s not up to me.  That\\'s up to them.  They already have great players there.  I feel like all together we\\'re going to be a pretty good team.'}, 'Tyler Herro': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=151247', 'text': \"Q.

I just controlled what I could control.  I had pretty good workouts throughout the process, and I just let that take care of itself. Q. You look handsome today.  Who helped you in picking out your outfit? TYLER HERRO: Just my stylist.  She helped me just picked out different colors and different things. Q. What do you know about Pat Riley? TYLER HERRO: He's a former Kentucky guy.  Obviously he has a great tradition in Miami. What they've done, they've won a lot of games and a lot of series and championships. Q. Did you get to meet him? TYLER HERRO: Yes, sir. Q. Did he make you nervous? TYLER HERRO: No, sir. Q. What are you more excited about as a guy who grew up in Wisconsin, getting to spend warm winters or no state income tax in the state of Florida? TYLER HERRO: Probably the warm weather.  Finally get to spend some winters where it's not too cold.  I'm just excited to get to Miami and get started. Q. You're not going to miss the snow at all? TYLER HERRO: Not at all. Q. I was just wondering how you think your game fits with the Miami Heat roster? TYLER HERRO: I think I can just bring shooting to stretch the floor.  Really whatever the Heat need me to do, I think I can come in and do it.  I'm happy to do whatever they need. Q. When we talked to you yesterday, you said you didn't know if you'd smile or cry when you got drafted.  What were your reactions when you got drafted? TYLER HERRO: It's just a dream come true.  It was crazy to hear my name get called, so it was just good vibes.  I'm happy I got selected early. Q. We saw you stretch the floor at Kentucky and you also show that you have a little bit of a handle and you can break people down, but getting to the basket in the NBA, how do you see yourself matching up with that physicality, getting to the basket?  Or do you think there's anything you need to work on in terms of finishing at the rim? TYLER HERRO: Just getting stronger.  I think obviously making the adjustment to playing against grown men in the NBA.  It's all a learning curve.  It'll be an experience that's a new experience for me.  I'll take every day one step at a time and just learn something new every day. Q. Getting drafted right after PJ, he was jumping up and down in the back on the radio set.  How cool is it you guys are going back to back in the draft? A. We talked about it actually, going back to back.  That would be cool.  Just happy that he got drafted.  It was very cool to see him get drafted.  I know how hard he works and how hard he wants it.  I was happy to see him get picked.\"}, 'Jaxson Hayes': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=151243', 'text': \"Q. How can you summarize your feelings about tonight so far?

I know it's early, but how do you think your game will pair with Zion Williamson? JAXSON HAYES: I think it will pair really well.  We're both really athletic guys.  Zion obviously is a freak.  But I feel like we'll match up really well together. Q. You're the third Texas center in a row to go in the first round.  Another one plays in this building - Jarrett Allen.  He tweeted out a congratulations to you.  Have you had any contact with him?  Is he someone you've tried to model your game after? JAXSON HAYES: Yeah, I've met Jarrett a few times.  He's given me a lot of advice, as well as some older big guys that went to University of Texas.  Yeah, they've just given me a lot of advice really. Q. Over the summer, what are some of the skills or moves you are looking forward to adding to your arsenal to prepare for the regular season? JAXSON HAYES: I'm looking to add more shooting into my game.  Also more of an outside game, so kind of like a trailer.  get the ball, maybe handle it a little bit.  So just stuff like that. Q. Where do you think you grew the most in your one year at Texas?  How do you think that's going to serve you at the pro level? JAXSON HAYES: I feel like I grew the most in my offensive game.  I've always kind of had my defensive game to kind of put my name on, something that I pride myself on.  But I feel like my offensive game came along way well while I was at Texas.  I just want to thank the coaches for that.\"}, 'Rui Hachimura': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=151242', 'text': \"Q.

Yeah, that's it. Q. How surprised were you that you were taken ninth overall today given that you were projected to go somewhere in the mid teens? RUI HACHIMURA: Those are media guys projecting.  On the inside, my agents are working, and I think they did a good job.  I was ready for this, yeah. Q. You hadn't met with the Washington Wizards before you were drafted.  Had you spoken to anybody before you were picked from the Washington Wizards? RUI HACHIMURA: No. Q. What are some goals that you want to accomplish in the NBA? RUI HACHIMURA: First of all, I want to play in the playoffs.  Of course, I want to help the team.  I want a championship.  I think that's the one thing I want to accomplish here. Q. Generally when Americans think of Japanese athletes, mostly we think about baseball players.  Was that a game you played?  Was basketball big growing up?

I wanted to ask you growing up as a kid if you had an NBA player that you idolized or looked up to? RUI HACHIMURA: I think the first player I liked, I think Carmelo.  I liked Carmelo, how he plays.  He's the same position.  He's big but he can shoot.  Do whatever.  I liked to watch him. Q. If Brandon Clarke is drafted later, that would be the first Gonzaga teammates drafted ever in the same draft.  What would that mean to you? RUI HACHIMURA: It's great.  He's a great player.  I played with him last year.  He works hard every day.  Gonzaga is one of the best programs in the country.\"}, 'Darius Garland': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=151233', 'text': \"Q.

It's always been a dream of mine, so I'm really happy. Q. Tell me about your suit, the story behind it. DARIUS GARLAND: This is a Fear of God suit made by Jerry Lorenzo, Mr. Boswell and Ms. Teresa.  I just want to be different.  More comfortable than wearing the actual suit. It's what we came up with. Q. Talk about going to Cleveland.  Were you a little surprised, because they have another point guard there, both you guys together could be pretty interesting? DARIUS GARLAND: No, I wasn't surprised at all.  I think me and Collin [Sexton] will play really well together.  You see Damian Lillard and CJ McCollum playing really well, playing in the playoffs.  The future is really bright for us. Q. Talk about the road to recovery the past few months, how that's been, how your knee is feeling right now. DARIUS GARLAND: It's been a long road.  But everybody faces adversity.  I got over the hump.  I'm 100% now.  That's in the past.  I'm ready to get to Cleveland, start working. Q. Have you spoken with Coach Beilein at all?  How do you think you'll fit into his vision? DARIUS GARLAND: Yeah, I talked to him before.  The vision is going to be bright, like I said.  The two guards we have, Collin, hopefully me coming into this position.  There's a lot of really young talent.  I'm really excited to get working. Q. Bryce [Drew] obviously isn't coaching at Vanderbilt any more.  He's somebody you've known for a long time, spoke highly of you when he was there.  How did it feel to have him by your side tonight? DARIUS GARLAND: It was really fun to see him.  It was good to see him.  Hadn't seen him in a while.  Catching up with him, having good conversations.  Remembering the past, the short time we had at Vanderbilt, it was really fun. Q. Who was your idol growing up?  Who do you think your game is most like in the league? DARIUS GARLAND: My idol was my dad.  He's been by my side since I can remember. But I don't really model my game after anyone.  I just have to get the best that I can be.  I watch a lot of guards and take bits and pieces from every other guard.  I just have to be the best that I can be. Q. You will be connected together as the class of 2019.  What do you think as a class you all bring together for the league? DARIUS GARLAND: Together I believe that we bring a lot of excitement.  You can tell Zion, RJ, Cam, Ja Morant, we bring a lot of excitement to the crowd.  I think we can draw a lot of people to the games, come out and support.  I believe that we just bring that as a class. Q. Have you had any conversations with Collin yet about what how it could play out, how you could complement one another? DARIUS GARLAND: No, I haven't talked to Collin yet.

A guy who is rooting for my teammates, always trying to make sure my teammates are doing okay and making sure everybody on the team is doing what they're supposed to do. Like I said, I think basketball-wise a lot of things are going to take care of itself.  I think I work hard enough to make sure that everything else, which includes my skills in basketball, are going to be fine.

Can you just describe or summarize how your experience has gone tonight so far. SEKOU DOUMBOUYA: Great experience.  I'm just happy. Q. We just saw in the Finals a team like the Raptors, very international team.  Did the pipeline of international players inspire you at all growing up, have a big impact on you? SEKOU DOUMBOUYA: Yeah, everybody.  Siakam, Ibaka.  Everybody.  It's a big inspiration for the African people, African players.  Yeah, I'm proud of that. Q. You kind of fit the mold of that modern two-way forward.  You've been compared to Pascal Siakam.  If there's a skill, particularly offensively, that you see yourself really trying to work on into your rookie year and as you get into your career that you want to kind of master, what would that be? SEKOU DOUMBOUYA: Yeah, I'm agreeing with that.  I feel like I play like Siakam.  I just got to work right now.  Prove to myself, to the team, what I can do.  Do my best on the floor. Q. What do you think will be one of the biggest challenges as you start adjusting to the NBA lifestyle? SEKOU DOUMBOUYA: I think it's going to be the schedule.  In the NBA, they travel a lot.  They take airplanes like every day.  I think that's going to be the biggest adjustment for me. Q. In one word, how would you describe this whole New York experience this week? SEKOU DOUMBOUYA: Fantastic (smiling). Q. Being drafted tonight, what do you think it means for the other kids in your country right now looking up to you?

What advantages do you feel like you've had in playing overseas?  How do you think that will help you in your NBA career? SEKOU DOUMBOUYA: I'm a pro right now.

JARRETT CULVER: I\\'m very excited just to make it to the NBA.  I\\'m very blessed to be in the position I\\'m in, and thankful for the opportunity. Q. Lubbock, Texas, I\\'m showing my age here, but I remember Buddy Holly being the most famous celebrity coming out of Lubbock.  Any familiarity with the music?  And on a more basketball note, you\\'re used to playing in hot climates.  Going to Phoenix must be a natural fit for you? JARRETT CULVER: Yeah, Buddy Holly, he\\'s an icon down there.  His statue is still there.  Just for me coming out of Lubbock and making it to the NBA, it\\'s a blessing, like I said.  I mean, it doesn\\'t get any better than that.  I\\'m not expected to make it here out of Lubbock, Texas, and I\\'m glad I could do something for my city. Q. What kind of legacy did Coach Beard help you leave at Texas Tech that can now help you at this level? JARRETT CULVER: The legacy he left, because he\\'s a winner.  Everything he does, it\\'s about winning.  Every move he makes, it\\'s about winning.  He kind of instilled that in to me to be a winner.  It takes a lot to be a winner.  You\\'ve got to work hard, you\\'ve got to be dedicate and you\\'ve got to put others before you sometimes.  At the end of the day, he taught me to be a winner.  I\\'ll be forever thankful for that and carry that on to wherever I go. Q. What thoughts were going through your mind after your name was called? JARRETT CULVER: First thing I did was just thank God.  I wouldn\\'t have got here without God, and the opportunity I had is truly a blessing.  My thought was I\\'m glad my family was there, and I\\'m excited that my dream became reality today. Q. You potentially get to play alongside Devin Booker.  What about learning from him? JARRETT CULVER: I\\'m very excited to play in the league.  He\\'s a great player.  There are a lot of things going on, so I don\\'t know who I\\'m going to be playing beside yet.  But I\\'m just glad to be there. Q. Do you have a dream car? JARRETT CULVER: I don\\'t have a dream car.  I\\'ve never really been into cars like that.  I know I\\'m going to have to eventually get one, but I don\\'t have a dream one. Q. You entered Texas Tech as I think a three-star recruit.  You weren\\'t really a lottery talent.  Did that kind of fuel you, people discounting you along the way? JARRETT CULVER: Yeah, this has been my whole life, and that\\'s why I play with a chip on my shoulder.  I\\'ve got a lot to prove and I take the doubters and haters to every workout and work even harder.  There\\'s a lot of motivation out there, and I\\'ve got to make sure I stay motivated.  That\\'s a piece of what they do.  That\\'s why I stay motivated. Q. Earlier today you had tweeted out \"God has got a blessing with my name on it,\" #draft day.  Were you at all nervous about sending out that tweet or was it just showing how confident you were in knowing you were going to hear your name? JARRETT CULVER: I wasn\\'t nervous at all.  Those are lyrics right there, \"God has got a blessing with my name on it.\"  I listen to that song every morning, so I tweeted it out this morning.  It kind of speaks volumes to me just because whatever God has for me, wherever I go, wherever I land and whatever happens in the future, it\\'s my blessing with my name on it.  So I just tweeted it out.  I was very thankful for that. Q. Is it weird to wear the Suns not knowing that you\\'re probably playing for Minnesota coming up? JARRETT CULVER: Yeah, it\\'s kind of different.  I\\'m just happy to be in the NBA and have this opportunity.  It\\'s a lot of work to be done.  So wherever I end up, I\\'ve got to stay true to myself and give whatever team I\\'m playing for everything I\\'ve got. Q. I was wondering what kind of teammate was [Davide] Moretti, and do you think you\\'ll have maybe one day a chance to play in the NBA? JARRETT CULVER: He for sure has a chance to play in the NBA.  Just the person he is and his work ethic.  Our relationship this year has grown so much.  That\\'s one of my closest friends on the team.  We worked out every day together.  We worked hard.  We was always hanging out.  We talk to each other.  We still talk to this day.  That\\'s like a lifelong brother to me.'}, 'Nicolas Claxton': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=151262', 'text': \"Q. If you could just start off talking about your style of play and what you bring to the new team? NICOLAS CLAXTON: My style of play, I bring a lot of energy.  I'm definitely an energy guy, high-energy guy.  Being able to switch, being able to guard multiple positions, doing a great job of that.  I'm going to continue to work on stretching my game that way. Being consistent with my jump shot.  Continuing to add some muscle.  I'm going to be a force in the NBA. Q. You are coming into the league now and you're going to be matched up with grown men, physical centers.  Just talk about what you're going to be doing in terms of putting on weight and kind of filling out your frame to be able to bang down low. NICOLAS CLAXTON: Yeah, that's something that I know that's going to be really critical for me, just making sure that I continue to put on some good weight, good strength.  But I'll just work extremely hard in the weight room, like I've been doing these past few years, and the rest will take care of itself, really. Q. I can't help but ask because you've just been drafted in the building where your team is going to play.  Do you have any past experience with Brooklyn or New York City, and what impression has it made on you so far? NICOLAS CLAXTON: Yeah, it's been great.  I was here two or three weeks ago.  I came here for a visit.  I worked out for the team, and I really enjoyed it.  I knew it was a pretty good possibility that I would be picked here. To be picked here, it's a blessing.  I'm ready to get to work here in Brooklyn.  I couldn't have scripted anything any better.  I feel like God, he already has everything all planned out for me, and I'm just following in his footsteps. Q. When did you start playing basketball, and when did you realize that your dream to be in the NBA was coming to fruition? NICOLAS CLAXTON: I first started playing basketball when I was around the age of 2.  My dad, he would buy a whole bunch of basketballs and just have them laying around the house, kind of a setup to get me to play basketball low key.  I realized that I had a good chance to go to the NBA -- it was just this past year, honestly.  I had a breakout game when we played against Georgia Tech.  That's when I really realized, I can really do this. Q. Jarrett Allen made a similar transition into the league being a big man and putting on the weight.  How much will you lean on Allen to make that transition, and how excited are you to kind of form a twin towers with him? NICOLAS CLAXTON: Oh, man.  I look forward to that.  Jarrett Allen, I am familiar with his game.  I know he's a great, great shot blocker.  Me and him on the same court, especially once I put some weight on, that's really going to be pressure for anybody that we're playing against.  I really will rely on him and try to build a pretty good relationship with him, so he can help me out in any way possible. Q. Offensively a lot of scouts have called you the most versatile offensive player or center in this draft.  They say you can handle, you can shoot.  Can you talk a little bit about what you think you can bring offensively to the Nets at the NBA level. NICOLAS CLAXTON: Yeah, my game starts off with defense, but offensively I have a great handle for my size.  I'm going to continue to work on my jump shot.  I can hit an open jump shot.  I have a lot of confidence in myself.  I feel like I'll definitely be able to do a lot, being able to post up, being able to take bigger guys outside and working them that way.  My offensive game, that's something I'm really going to develop and continue to work on.\"}, 'Brandon Clarke': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=151253', 'text': \"Q. How are you feeling about tonight?  How are things going?  Just a general overview of tonight so far. BRANDON CLARKE: Yeah, it's kind of tough to not be anxious when you're just sitting there and you're waiting for your name to be called.  But just after I finally heard my name called, pretty much all that bad feeling went away and all that anxious stuff went away.  I'm just really grateful that I heard my name called tonight. Q. Until tonight, Gonzaga has never had two first-round picks.  How does that make you feel to make history? BRANDON CLARKE: Yeah, that's awesome.  That's really cool because Gonzaga has just had lots of really great players.  For me and Rui to be the first two to be drafted in the first round is just something that's awesome. Q. What are your initial thoughts on being part of the Memphis Grizzlies?  Have you ever experienced the city at all? BRANDON CLARKE: I don't think I've actually been there before, but I think that's really cool.  I was actually kind of looking forward to going somewhere that I haven't really been before.  I just really can't wait to get there and get to work. Q. You haven't had much time to think about it, but that's your impression of Ja Morant and Jaren Jackson? BRANDON CLARKE: Yeah, I've watched them both plenty and I think it'll be very fun playing with them both.  Ja is clearly one of the most fun players to watch ever to me, and Jaren is also a very great talent.  I'm just really looking forward to being able to play with those guys. Q. How do you see your game projecting at the next level?  What position do you see yourself sliding in, and what do you feel like your skill set is at the NBA level? BRANDON CLARKE: I can play a four, three.  I can play a five, two.  It will probably start with just playing defense really.  I can block shots, guard pretty much anybody on the floor, in the paint.  My shot is just getting better and better.  There's lots of stuff I'll do to help teams win games. Q. You mentioned that you've watched a good amount of Ja and a good amount of Jaren.  What is it about their games that really sticks out that you think you're going to be able to mesh so well with them? BRANDON CLARKE: First off, Ja is a really, really good passer.  I play well with point guards.  I can pass the ball well.  And Jaren is just a really good talent, too, a really strong dude who can shoot it and also drive it.  It's always fun playing with dudes like that.  I just played with Rui and it was pretty much similar to that.  Ja is just a really good passer and he's a really, really bouncy player, too.  So I'm sure we're going to have some very fun highlights to watch. Q. I know you haven't spent the most time in Canada, but you were born there.  And for this year overall looking back at the Raptors winning a championship, a bunch of guys with Canadian ancestry have been drafted already this season.  Looking back the past few years, there have been a lot of guys that have been drafted from Canada.  How do you think that's kind of seen the rise of Canadian basketball as a whole the last few seasons? BRANDON CLARKE: Yeah, I just feel like there's lots of talents coming out of there now.  I'm not sure why it took so long, but I would just say probably because basketball is getting bigger and bigger and it's gotten much bigger, too, in Canada.  And also with the Raptors winning, that's going to make it even bigger.  It's just been really fun to watch the evolution of basketball in the country. Q. What does it mean having those Canadian roots, an opportunity to wear the maple leaf and see these young stars, another generation come to the rise and perhaps take Canada basketball to another level? BRANDON CLARKE: It's really awesome.  I'm a huge fan of every player that comes out of the country of Canada.  To see players come out of there and be very good is something that's awesome.  I'm somebody who grew up watching Nash play and I always thought it was really cool he was from Canada because I am, too.  RJ Barrett obviously is somebody who's going to be huge for them.  So it's just really cool seeing the next big player coming out of Canada. Q. How do you see yourself fitting next to Jaren Jackson specifically given his skill set, being a rim protecting big that can also stretch the floor?  Do you see yourself as a big next to him, as a wing?  Where do you fall as far as that? BRANDON CLARKE: I would probably say a big next to him.  I can play the wing, too, but probably a big next to him.  I feel like in the paint it'll be really tough to finish through us, over us.  With him shooting, it's something I'm going to get better at, too.  It'll make us a real good duo. Q. Two quick questions about Canada.  You were born and raised in Vancouver.  How much did your family or did you remember about the Grizzlies being back then as Vancouver team?  And how much did you have a chance to know Dillon Brooks? BRANDON CLARKE: I think that my mom brought me to a game when I was like 1 or 2, so obviously I don't really have that much memory of that.  I moved to Phoenix when I was about 3 or 4.  I still have lots of family there, though, so I like to go back often. Dillon Brooks, I don't really know that much about him.  I know he's a good player and I watch him a bit, but on a personal level I don't really know him that much. Q. I know Jaren has been floating around a bit tonight.  Did you get a chance to talk to him after he got selected?  Did he tell you anything like that? BRANDON CLARKE: I actually haven't yet, but I'm sure I'll be talking to him very shortly.\"}, 'Bol Bol': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=151263', 'text': 'Q. How would you describe your style of play? BOL BOL: My style of play, 7\\'2\", I can space the floor very well.  I can pass very well and shoot and dribble pretty well for my size. Q. You only played nine games for Oregon in the regular season, but I want you to tell me what parts of your game you improved just by watching film or team meetings. BOL BOL: I definitely improved on my shot blocking, my timing.  And defensively it wasn\\'t showing because I only played nine games, but every single game I was learning more and more on the defensive side. Q. Throughout the whole draft, your friend Shareef O\\'Neal was supporting you and telling everyone that you were going to be the steal of the draft.  I just want you to tell me about your relationship with him and how you think he\\'s going to do next year for the UCLA Bruins. BOL BOL: Me and him, we are very close ever since we started playing AAU together from around 17 years.  We\\'ve been close friends ever since.  I think he will do fine next year, and I\\'m looking forward to playing against him next year hopefully. Q. You get the invite into the green room.  What\\'s it like to finally get drafted and finally get taken by a team after falling a little bit farther than you would have liked? BOL BOL: It was a little rough at first, but it\\'s just a blessing just being able to get drafted.  That was the main focus, just being drafted. Q. How do you think you can improve your teammates this year?  Do you think you can contribute to your team in a positive manner? BOL BOL: Definitely, because my transitioning is pretty good.  I pick up things very well.  So with the right teammates around me, I\\'ll be able to help, definitely. Q. Going a little bit off of that, it\\'s reported you\\'re headed to Denver.  Any thoughts about possibly playing along Nikola Jokic, Jamal Murray, those guys? BOL BOL: They\\'re both great players.  Jokic is actually one of the players I started watching a lot because of his passing.  I take that a lot from his game.  I think they\\'re a very great team, and I\\'m very excited. Q. How does it feel to know you\\'re going to be going to a situation where you\\'re going to be playing really important basketball games for a team with championship expectations right away? BOL BOL: I think it\\'s good for me because I\\'ll be around very great players and a good staff.  I think that will help develop me.  That will better me.

I watched them in the playoffs, too.  I really like Victor Oladipo.  I think I can bring a lot of stuff into their game.  Stretch the floor.  Help them do a lot of good stuff for the team offensively, defensively.  Be competitive, bring a lot of positive energy and be productive on both ends of the floor. Q. Playing overseas, a lot of fans might not have seen your game.  How would you describe your style of play?  How do you like to play? GOGA BITADZE: I like to play hard, be really competitive on the floor, bring a lot of positive energy for the team.  And be productive on both ends of the floor.  Be able to compete and try to win every single game. Q. A lot of the prospects from the States are looking at overseas pro careers at an early age.  Based on your previous pro experiences, what advice would you give to the kids who chose overseas experiences over NCAA? GOGA BITADZE: They have to play tougher, be tougher, because there are grown men.  It's a grown men's league.  There are no kids over there.  There is all grown men.  They got to be tough every single game, every single day, trying to work hard, outwork other guys, veterans, other pro players who are older and stronger than them.  They need to work hard and be tough on the floor. Q. As a kid, did you have a favorite player growing up?  Now that you're in your rookie season, is there a favorite city you would like to visit? GOGA BITADZE: Yeah, to visit, first of all, Indiana. Growing up, I had lot of favorite players.  I can't really count them right now.  I had a lot of them.  One of them was KG, Kevin Garnett, because I like how he competed, how tough he was on the floor. Q. When pick 18 came, you heard your name called, what emotions were going through you?  Who is the first person you thanked, hugged? GOGA BITADZE: I was shaking, literally.  I was nervous.  But this dream came true.  I'm really honored that I'm here.  I'm going to focus on basketball, hard work.  This is for my family definitely back in Georgia right now.  They're watching.  This is for them.  They came to my mind, the whole process.  I was doing it for them.  This is for them. Q. Is there one or two favorite quotes that you kept as a motivation throughout the process of chasing this hoop dream? GOGA BITADZE: Winners never quit, quitters never win.  That's it.  That's my quote I think.  It's really good for me.  I go out there and watch this quote every day.  It is in my mind.  I try to never quit.\"}, 'RJ Barrett': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=151236', 'text': \"Q. Could you talk about your feelings about being picked by the Knicks? RJ BARRETT: What do I say?  I'm so overwhelmed, humbled and just honored and very thankful that the Knicks took the chance with me, that they believed in me.  I'm so happy to be a Knick, and I can't wait to play in Madison Square Garden. Q. You said yesterday you may have some tears, and sure enough, you did.  What were the emotions running through your mind at that point?  It looked like tears were coming down. RJ BARRETT: Yeah, even before I got picked, I was trying not to just let it come out.  I feel like I've worked so hard my whole life and just for this day to come, and now that it's here and to hear my name called and walk across that stage, I just had to let it out. Q. Obviously the crowd was excited and they chanted your name.  What was that like hearing that after you were picked? RJ BARRETT: That was great.  I'm glad that the city wants me here as much as I want to be here. Q. You spoke yesterday how when you were growing up as a kid your grandfather told you one day you would play for the Knicks.  How much were you thinking about your grandfather when the pick was finally in and you knew you were going to play your career in New York? RJ BARRETT: That was crazy.  That was one of the reasons why I was crying, because we used to watch the Knicks growing up and he would always tell me I was going to be a Knick.  I'm sad he can't be here to see it.  But I'm just very happy, man. Q. A question about the influence of your dad growing up.  He had a good professional career in Europe.  And is going to the Knicks going to change your decision of playing with the national team this summer? RJ BARRETT: Well, my dad, oh, man, that's the guy that got me going in basketball.  Watching him is where I got my passion.  So he's definitely been one of the biggest influences in my life. Playing for Team Canada is still to be determined.  I have no clue what's going to happen.  I have no clue what the team is going to say or haven't really discussed it with my family yet, so I don't know what's going to happen. Q. You are the proof that dreams can come true, so what did it take, and what are the qualities you possess today that might make you one of the best in the league? RJ BARRETT: It took a lot of discipline.  First of all, thank you very much.  But took a lot of discipline, a lot of early-morning workouts when I didn't want to go, a lot of staying home and getting rest while people are out having fun.  So just took a lot of hard work and being uncomfortable doing things that you don't want to do.  I don't know what else to say. Q. We see that you and Zion have been supporting each other through this whole process.  What did he say to you right when you got off the stage there when you embraced? RJ BARRETT: We just told each other how happy we were for each other.  I told him I loved him, he told me he loved me, and we're ready to get to work now. Q. What does it mean to be a Canadian and get drafted as high as you did?  And the second part is your father and the bond that you guys have and potentially an opportunity to lead Canada to the Olympics much like your dad did. RJ BARRETT: It's amazing to be Canadian.  We take a lot of pride.  That's why I've got my Canadian flags on this side of my jacket.  To put it on for our country, that means a lot.  My dad, man, is big.  He's big with Canada basketball.  He's big with me.  He helps me through everything.  So yeah, I love him. Q. Probably going to be five or six Canadians picked tonight.  What does that say about the status of Canadian basketball and what does it mean to be the face of it going forward? RJ BARRETT: It feels great.  Canadian basketball is really on the rise.  You see we have -- like you said, probably six, maybe more, in the draft this year.  We have probably four of us going in the first round.  So it's just amazing.  Canada basketball is on the rise.  We're going to have to cut some NBA players from the team this summer.  But it's great. Q. Reflect on the draft experience, doing it with two of your teammates and good friends. RJ BARRETT: Man, it's great.  To see Z go first and me go 3, I don't know where Cam is or Cam ends up yet, but it felt great.  I mean, we worked so hard and we had so many conversations over the year, definitely getting to learn about each other and learn what everyone goes through or went through to get to this point.  So to see all our dreams being achieved is a special moment. Q. You're coming to a relatively young team with a huge fan base and obviously intense media coverage in New York.  What do you think you bring to the locker room, on the court and in the locker room, just as far as personality and how you can relate to other players and kind of build that team up? RJ BARRETT: On the court, excitement.  Hard worker, competitive, just make plays on both ends of the floor.  You're going to see a lot of exciting things from me.  And then in the locker room, I actually grew up in Europe half my life and then Canada and the States the other half of my life, so I feel like I can connect with anybody.  I'm definitely a personality. Q. You just said that you are a personality, you can connect with a lot of people, so it seems like New York is a perfect space for you.  A lot of people talk about how New York is more flashy and people are more in the spotlight.  Can you talk about how you've maybe mentally prepared for this stage as opposed to any other team because New York is such a big mecca? RJ BARRETT: Well, I call New York just a bigger version of Toronto.  I'm kind of used to it already.  When it comes to everything on the court with the fan base and everything, I just feel like -- I went to Duke, we got a lot of attention.  Being in New York there's going to be a lot more, but I've just been built this way to handle it.  Yeah, I'll be fine. Q. How much did it mean for you to get that ovation from the fans because there have been some draft picks here in this town that don't get that ovation. RJ BARRETT: I watched, yeah.  That was great.  I mean, how would you feel if people were screaming your name?  You'd feel great.  I really feel like I'm doing something good.  All my hard work is paying off.  I know that like Kareem said, you have nothing to prove but you have everything to prove.  This is a new start, so I'm ready to go. Q. How excited are you about going to the Knicks, and knowing how many options are on the table in terms of cap room and future assets? RJ BARRETT: I'm not thinking about none of that stuff.  I'm going to see kind of what happens there.  I don't know enough to speak on that.  I just know that I'm going to be on the team. Q. Madison Square Garden is obviously basketball's mecca.  Every basketball player wishes to leave a legacy.  LeBron James calls it his playground, Kevin Durant loves the energy that it brings.  What do you love about Madison Square Garden, and what legacy do you want to leave there? RJ BARRETT: Well, I was fortunate enough to play there once this year with Duke.  That was one of the craziest environments I've ever been in.  I'm a player that plays with a lot of passion, competitiveness and excitement, so to be able to go in a home arena that has such a great fan base like that is going to make the game so much more fun.  It's going to be great. Q. I know your father played in Europe several years.  I'm not sure if you were with him when he did, and he played -- RJ BARRETT: He played in Cantu. Q. In Cantu, exactly.  Were you there, and what do you remember of that experience? RJ BARRETT: I was there.  Italy was a lot of fun.  I remember eating a lot of pasta.  And the arena was actually right across the street from where I lived, so it was great.  I watched my dad go to practice and go to the games every day as a young kid.  I just remember that gym being crazy. Q. I believe your parents met in Queens at St. John's University.  Was there any thought of playing at SJU? RJ BARRETT: I mean, they didn't really recruit me, but if they did -- Q. We could have used you at Columbia, too. RJ BARRETT: It would have been a thought. Q. Is that something that kind of got you excited about New York aside from the size of the market? RJ BARRETT: Yeah, of course.  My parents met here.  My mom grew up here.  We have family over here, too.  My mom is from Brooklyn.  So everything is really exciting. Q. Your godfather, Steve Nash, tweeted before that he's telling everyone that his godson is on TV and he's probably going to the Knicks and no big deal.  What has he meant to you and what advice has he given you so far? RJ BARRETT: He's a Hall of Famer, right?  You wouldn't even know it if you spoke to him.  He's the nicest guy.  He's the most humble guy ever.  Especially he's been really big for me during this draft process.  He checks on me basically every day or almost every other day to see if I'm good, see how I'm feeling, giving me advice.  I'm very thankful for him. Q. There's a lot of Duke players across the league.  Fortunately for you you have one Duke teammate Lance Thomas on the Knicks.  How excited are you to play against some fellow Duke players and having a teammate on the Knicks? RJ BARRETT: First of all, that's great.  The brotherhood is very strong.  The brotherhood is everywhere, so I'm very excited to go.  I met Lance before.  He's a great guy.  So I'm very excited to work with him.\"}, 'Nickeil Alexander-Walker': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=151251', 'text': \"Q. Just describe your style of play and what you'll bring to your new team. NICKEIL ALEXANDER-WALKER: I think my versatility, playmaking ability on both sides of the ball.  I think my length allows me to defend multiple positions.  My playmaking allows me to pass, shoot, score, make plays for others, make plays for myself.  Put points on the board. Q. I see you have the Nets hat on, but I understand the machinations and you probably won't be playing in Brooklyn.  Is that disappointing or were you looking to be in the big city? NICKEIL ALEXANDER-WALKER: I'm from Toronto. Q. That's pretty big. NICKEIL ALEXANDER-WALKER: Yeah, it's a big time right now in the city.  I'm glad it's turned around.  That means I chose the right profession.  But I'm just thankful.  Either team that wants me, I'm just going to come in and be the best player I can be. Try to give them as much as I can and work every day.  That's all I can control and try to do. Q. When you say you grew up in Toronto, like up through a certain age, and did you play hockey? NICKEIL ALEXANDER-WALKER: In gym class, I played hockey.  Anything outside, I did not.  I wasn't really into much but basketball.  From the moment I touched it, it had my heart. Q. But you could still skate if need be? NICKEIL ALEXANDER-WALKER: No. Q. You talk about being from Toronto.  Looking at Canadian basketball as a whole, with so many players from Canada being eligible in this draft.  Some have been taken already. The Raptors having won the NBA title.  Just this past year, how do you think that's helped grow the game of basketball as a whole in Canada between the championship for them, all you guys being eligible to be drafted, your cousin [Shai Gilgeous-Alexander] coming in from the draft last year? NICKEIL ALEXANDER-WALKER: It's given it a chance, opportunity.  I feel like it's showing more and more kids that were in my position that you can one day be here just like I am.  I know guys like Andrew Wiggins and Tyler Ennis gave me hope.  Now as RJ [Barrett] got selected.  I got selected.  Hopefully more Canadians who get selected can kind of give those kids and other generations hope. Q. When your name has been called and you're walking to the podium, what are some thoughts that flooded through your mind? NICKEIL ALEXANDER-WALKER: Don't fall.  Thank you, God.  And just try not to cry. Q. One guy whose name has not been mentioned tonight, Anthony Bennett, did not have a great career, but he was a first-round pick here.  Are you in touch with him? NICKEIL ALEXANDER-WALKER: I know he's playing right now.  He's working really hard.  I think he also paved the way in a sense.  I apologize for not mentioning his name. Him making history, doing something that all Canadians and Torontonians where I'm from dreamed of: Being that No. 1 pick.\"}}, 2020: {'Tyrell Terry': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=161039', 'text': \"Q. How do you see yourself fitting in in Dallas alongside Luka and Kristaps Porzingis? TYRELL TERRY:   I think for me, just the way I'm able to shoot the ball, I'm going to be a valuable tool for Luka, especially off pick-and-rolls and finding shooters and also being a secondary ball handler for that role as well.  Being able to create -- space the floor for Kristaps is going to be important, I think.  So I think I'll be a very good fit for them. Q. Congrats on being drafted and welcome to Dallas.  It sounds like you've kind of analyzed the Mavs a little bit.  Was this something you've anticipated?  Were they one of the teams that were pretty high on your radar? TYRELL TERRY:   Well, thank you for welcoming me to Dallas, first off. Second, to answer your question, yeah, this is one of the teams where I know it was a possibility I could end up, and it was a situation where I wanted to be in.  So I think this draft went very well for me.  I plan to go into Dallas and show them my work ethic, show them what I can do. Q. And what was the most -- did you meet them by Zoom or in person?  What stood out about the organization as you talked to them? TYRELL TERRY:   I did meet with them in Zoom multiple times.  I took some assessments for them as far as IQ goes.  I think for me, you know, they see my fit with their roster, and I see my fit as well.  So for me to come in and just do my job, I think that's all I can do.  Hopefully, some success will be brought from that. Q. Tyrell, congratulations on getting drafted to Dallas.  Look forward to covering you.  I've got a question for you:  Great shooter, obviously.  When you studied film throughout your younger days and now getting into the league, who were some shooters that you looked at for as like the way to shoot, the craft, the form, different things of that nature? TYRELL TERRY:   I think for me growing up, I didn't really study shooting as much.  I think, when I started to realize I was a pretty prolific shooter in my opinion, that's when I started studying film of Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, those type of guys.  Obviously, Seth Curry was a member of the Dallas Mavericks last year.  So I think I could see myself in a similar role as that.  By studying the ways he's able to get his shot off and the way he's able to maneuver on the offensive end is something I've been studying. Q. And follow-up question real quick:  I know you're excited just to get on the court with these guys, with Luka and K.P., et cetera.  Is there a particular matchup or player that you're excited to face in this NBA?  I know that, like, obviously, you watch the game, and I'm pretty sure there's a player that you're looking forward to getting on the floor against and compete against. TYRELL TERRY:   Yeah.  I don't think there's one specific player that I'm most excited to go against, but I think for me, being a young guy, there's several players in this league that have established themselves since I was younger.  To face them and show them what I can bring to this league is something that I look forward to. Q. What does it mean for you to be in an organization with a lot of young guys and you're able to compete with players like Kristaps and Luka on the practices? TYRELL TERRY:   I think it's great for me to be on the roster with a lot of young guys, to kind of relate to them, kind of learn from them.  They've only been in the league for several years, but I think there's a lot to learn from them, me being a rookie coming in.  I think there's a lot of hungry guys on this roster, me being one of them coming up.  So of course I want to compete with these guys and show the NBA what we can do.  I think it's something that I look forward to. Q. And what result will make you satisfied at the end of the season? TYRELL TERRY:   I don't think many things satisfy me.  To come in and do my best and be a great teammate to these guys and motivate them to get better and have them motivate me to get better I think is something I would look at as a successful rookie year for myself. Q. I'm wondering how does a Minnesota kid get out to Stanford?  And have you heard from Dwight Powell yet after being drafted? TYRELL TERRY:   Yes.  So I got out to Stanford just because I thought it was a perfect fit for me as far as academics and athletics go.  I thought it was a perfect situation for me to come in and be successful right away. I haven't talked to Dwight yet.  I have his number.  I think it's pretty cool we're going to have a two Stanford guys on the same team. Q. There were four Minnesotans taken in the first 41 picks.  How much pride do you have about that, and what does it say about the talent in the state? TYRELL TERRY:   To have us all be selected tonight is an extreme blessing.  I congratulate those guys.  It does a lot for the state of Minnesota as far as recognition.  I think Minnesota is on the come-up as far as talent goes in the basketball world.  I hope the world kind of wakes up and realizes that now. Q. Tyrell, congratulations on being drafted to the Dallas Mavericks.  Welcome to the city of Dallas.  What have you done as far as your preparation during this pandemic and to get yourself to be ready for this Mavericks roster, in your mind? TYRELL TERRY:   I think the biggest thing for me to prepare myself for this big step is to add size and strength, but also improving my mental habits.  I started doing meditation and reading books.  I think it did a lot for me as far as being prepared and keeping a level head.  Obviously, this is a crazy night as far as emotions go, but when I wake up tomorrow morning, I'm going to be ready to work.\"}, \"Jahmi'us Ramsey\": {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=161032', 'text': \"Q. First off, congratulations.  Big night.  Can you tell me what you bring to the NBA.  Tell me what your best asset coming into the NBA. JAHMIâ€™US RAMSEY:   I feel like I bring a lot of versatility.  I can shoot the ball.  I come off screens.  I come off pin-downs.  I'm great in transition.  I feel like I play defense at a very high level, and I'm a winner. Q. Is there anything that you think you have to work on? JAHMIâ€™US RAMSEY:   I have to work on a lot of different areas of my game.  I have to sharpen up things I think I'm good at, and I definitely have to sharpen up things that I think I'm weak at. Q. Jahmiâ€™us, congratulations, man.  Just wanted to ask what this -- what that was like when you received a phone call, obviously, with the family and everybody soaking in that moment? JAHMIUS RAMSEY:   It felt good to find out my name was about to be called. Q. How much do you know about Sacramento?  Whether it's the city or the Kings.  How much do you know coming into this at all? JAHMIâ€™US RAMSEY:   I don't know much outside of they have De'Aaron Fox. Q. What are you looking forward to the most in terms of getting your NBA career started? JAHMIâ€™US RAMSEY:   Just coming in and working.  Looking forward to what's down the line for myself.  Pretty much just coming in and putting in the work, and I believe whatever I put in, I'll get out. Q. When you look at this entire situation, how strange this year has been, how has it affected you at all in terms of preparing for this night, this draft?  Obviously, this is a big moment, maybe the biggest moment of your life.  How has it been different maybe than what you would envision at, say, the start of the year? JAHMIâ€™US RAMSEY:   Really this year has taught me a lot of different things as far as growth, but one key one is patience.  This process has been really long.  COVID has been extended, 146 days from the original draft date, so a key one for me is patience. Q. You say that number like you've had it counting in your head every day.  Is it one of those things where you just are happy to be at the end of this particular tunnel? JAHMIâ€™US RAMSEY:   Yes, I'm ready to get to work. Q. How was your draft experience overall?  What was it like kind of waiting for your name to be heard?  Was there much surprise at all to see your name go to Sacramento? JAHMIâ€™US RAMSEY:   It was a wait, and I don't think it was much of a surprise just because I got a phone call before. Q. Did it come out of the blue?  Is it something that you kind of expected?  Did you have much interaction with Sacramento before today? JAHMIâ€™US RAMSEY:   I didn't.\"}, 'Payton Pritchard': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=161033', 'text': \"Q. If you'd start out with an opening statement about your game and what you'll bring to the Boston team. PAYTON PRITCHARD:   I just want to bring a sense of toughness, a guy that can really spread the floor, make plays, but just really toughness, competitiveness and try to help a team try to go win a ring and a championship. Q. If you were asked by a Celtics fan what are you bringing to the Celtics, how do you describe your game and what they're getting in your skill set? PAYTON PRITCHARD:   Well, I can really shoot it, dribble, pass, but I think the biggest thing that I bring to the Celtics is just a competitive nature, a winning mentality type of guy that fights for everything, works for everything. Q. Just wanted to ask what kind of conversations you had with the Celtics leading up to the draft, and did you have an inkling they might be looking at you at No. 26? PAYTON PRITCHARD:   I knew they were interested.  I did one interview with them.  I actually did not think that they would end up being the team I was going to go to, but very thankful.  Obviously, it's an unbelievable organization, so I'm ready to get to work. Q. Brad Stevens just said he's excited about the fact that you're going to be ready to compete right away.  You just talked about getting a championship.  What kind of role do you see for yourself as a rookie? PAYTON PRITCHARD:   I'm not sure yet.  I guess when I get down there, get ready to compete and try to win opportunities for playing time and all that. So that's all I'm worried about, is getting down there and competing for time and helping a team win.  We'll figure that out eventually. Q. We talked yesterday, you said that you wanted to go somewhere where they would appreciate that competitiveness.  Knowing that it's Danny Ainge, have you guys been friends?  Did you know each other with that Eugene tie, and what does it mean to go to somebody who has those ties to a place where you developed? PAYTON PRITCHARD:   I definitely know who Danny is.  We haven't formally met in person or anything like that, but obviously he's a very competitive person, and the Celtics organization is like the best.  That's what they thrive on. So I'm just excited to be part of this organization, be part of a winning culture.  Wherever I've been in high school, college, it's always been about winning and competing, and so I get to carry that on.  Hopefully I get to expand my game and win a lot of games. Q. Just talk about tonight hearing your name selected; what was that like being with your friends and family? PAYTON PRITCHARD:   It was a very emotional moment.  For me, it took a lot of hard work.  Definitely went through a lot of ups and downs in high school, college.  Just to finally get to this moment is unreal, and it was definitely filled with a lot of emotions with my mom and dad and stuff like that. So just excited. Q. What does it mean to you to represent the state of Oregon, all you've done here from the time you were a little boy to now, to have that moment and to know that you're representing an entire state?  What does that mean to you? PAYTON PRITCHARD:   It means a lot, being an Oregon boy.  There's obviously not a whole lot of people that made the NBA from here and stuff like that, but for me just to represent my state well and the University of Oregon means a whole lot.  And there's a lot more coming behind me.  It's a big moment. Q. Sticking on the Oregon theme, you obviously improved your game dramatically in your four years at Oregon.  What do you think Dana Altman and the staff at Oregon did to help you prepare to take your game to the NBA level? PAYTON PRITCHARD:   Just worked with me on a daily basis.  We always had a professional approach.  As far as Altman goes, he wanted the best for me, always pushed me, always was hard on me, never took it easy.  Always appreciative of that.  We won a lot of games, and we were successful.  They've built a professional approach to things.\"}, 'Tyrese Maxey': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=161036', 'text': \"Q. I'm wondering what went through your head in that big moment when your name was called tonight. TYRESE MAXEY:   The moment was -- I'm speechless about the moment.  I was very thankful for the organization on taking a chance on me, and I just can't wait to get to work. Q. I know you have a little bit of a connection to a couple Sixers on the current roster.  Why don't we start with Ben Simmons.  What's it been like to see him working out in this offseason, and what's your connection like? TYRESE MAXEY:   It's been great.  It's been great.  I've been watching him work out.  He works out like right after I was working out.  So it's great to watch him and watch him get ready and work on his game.  Ben's been doing really well.  I feel like shooting the ball well.  It's great to meet him.  I talked to him just a minute ago, and he just said be ready to get to work. Q. I know you also come from the same hometown as Zhaire Smith.  Is that true? TYRESE MAXEY:   Right, I do. Q. What's your relationship like with Zhaire? TYRESE MAXEY:   Zhaire is cool.  It's crazy, man.  His high school was five minutes away from my high school.  We were rivals back in the day.  It's going to be really cool.  I can't wait to talk to him. Q. Tyrese, welcome to Philly.  Tell me a little bit more about the connection you've got in this pre-draft process.  I guess you were working out in L.A.  I saw a tweet tonight from LeBron James.  Clearly, you've been on some of these guys' radar for a while. TYRESE MAXEY:   You know, I think it's because -- I stayed consistent.  I've been in the gym since May.  I went out to L.A. in May, and I've been there and working every single day.  I think everybody stops by, and I think they always see me in there working and grinding.  I think that's why we had that connection. It's been great having guys like LeBron and even Ben Simmons as older brothers and mentors.  For someone like me, a rookie coming into the league, it's great to have those guys on your side. Q. We saw you get emotional after you were drafted, talking about the moment.  What's going through your mind in that moment as you're getting emotional?  Is it all the hard work?  Is it your dream coming true?  Is it all of the above? TYRESE MAXEY:   You're right.  It's all of the above.  All the hard work and all the sacrifice that my parents have made for me.  They've had to sacrifice so much in their lives and do different things.  My siblings, uncle, my entire family had to sacrifice just so I could do certain things and try to chase my dreams.  For them to come true and for me to get an opportunity to show how hard I work and how much I appreciate the game, it means a lot. Q. A lot of guys say that the dream doesn't end here.  What can you bring to Philadelphia?  What can you bring to the Sixers? TYRESE MAXEY:   In my opinion, I bring a competitive nature.  I feel like I bring a winning spirit, as far as playing competitive on the defensive end, and even on the offensive end, I feel like I can help run a team.  I feel like I can score on and off the ball and be a great asset to the team. Q. So a lot of people had you going higher in this draft.  They expected you to at least be a lottery pick.  So from your point of view, are you carrying that chip on your shoulder?  And also as a follow-up, you have a lot of Kentucky guards that have kind of gone lower in the draft but then have really shown out, like Devin Booker or Tyler Herro.  Are you using them as kind of an example as well? TYRESE MAXEY:   Definitely, I use that.  I think I always play with a chip on my shoulder just because that's just how I am.  I'm extremely grateful for where I ended up.  I feel like it's a great opportunity for me, and I'm very thankful for Philly for giving me this shot.  I'm going to go out there and give it 110 percent and give it my all and make sure it's not a regret. Q. John Calipari has had a long string of guards who have successfully made that transition in the NBA.  What kind of advice did he give you about what you'll have to do to be successful? TYRESE MAXEY:   He told me just keep being myself.  Keep being myself and work extremely hard and show everybody what he already knows.  Show everybody that I can do multiple things and even more things than I was able to show at Kentucky. Q. Which players did you sort of pattern your game around?  Or guys that you looked at and said, hey, these are some elements that I want to take and use for my game as well? TYRESE MAXEY:   So when I grew to about 6-3, I started watching guys like CJ McCollum, the Jamal Murrays of the league, the Jrue Holidays.  Just because the league has changed so much, so these hybrid guards who were able to do multiple things and run a team and get their teammates involved and facilitate and score while they're playing on the ball, and also while they're off the ball, being able to do different things without having the ball in their hands, that's something I take pride in.  That's something I'll be able to do. Then I like to be competitive on the defensive end.  Jrue Holiday, I think, is a great defender, and that's where I get it from. Q. I want to know, what do you think you'll bring to the city?  The city is known for its grit and toughness.  What do you think you'll bring to the city? TYRESE MAXEY:   I think that's right up my alley, to be honest.  That's what I know.  That's how I grew up.  I grew up with the grit and toughness, and that's what is in my blood.  I think that's going to be a great fit, like you said.  I'm going to go in, and like I say, get 1 percent better every single day and try to bring a winning mentality. Q. I guess over the summer you were working out and everything with the likes of -- or in front of the likes of LeBron James, Ben Simmons.  I know you have a good relationship with those two cats, and now you'll actually be a teammate of Ben Simmons.  Can you talk to me about the mentorship and LeBron James and then your relationship with Ben Simmons. TYRESE MAXEY:   Yeah, you're right.  It is kind of crazy being a teammate of Ben Simmons now after seeing him in the gym and in the shop grinding all summer.  It's a dream come true.  I really appreciate guys like him and LeBron.  They've been telling me to stay with it, keep grinding and stay who I am, man.  Keep up the personality.  Just because you get drafted, that's not the end goal.  It's just a step in the building block.  I've been putting in this work.  This is for December 22nd, when we step on the court to compete against other teams. Q. First of all, what are your expectations about your collaboration with Ben Simmons, Doc Rivers.  And also what is the biggest motivation for you about next season? TYRESE MAXEY:   I think my biggest motivation for starting with that is just getting 1 percent better and trying to help this team win.  This team is in a really good position.  They have guys, like you said, like Joel Embiid and Ben, and they're in a winning situation.  I feel like I can come in and bring that winning mentality and bring that energy that can help us. Q. When did you realize during your season at Kentucky that you were ready for the league? TYRESE MAXEY:   While I was at Kentucky, I didn't really focus on being at the league.  My thing at Kentucky was, you know, Coach Cal said he had a role for me to play there, and that's what I did.  I wanted to win games, and I wanted to try to win a national title.  That was the only thing that was on my mind at the University of Kentucky is trying to help your team win a national title, do whatever it takes, do whatever Coach Cal needs you to do, and try to get better and work on your game, your overall game.  No matter what you have to do at Kentucky, work on your overall game for the future. That's what I did.  After the year was over, I sat down with him and he said he thought I was ready.  And we made that step. Q. You never know who you're going to see at the Wells Fargo Center on any given night when you're playing.  You see the likes of Kevin Hart a lot, you see the likes of Meek Mill in the arena a lot.  Philly is known for its hip-hop scene.  Do you have a favorite artist out of Philly? TYRESE MAXEY:   If I had to pick anybody out of that group, I'd probably say Meek Mill.  I like his flow.  He's pretty interesting to me. I can't wait.  That sounds like a great scene.  I live for moments like that. Q. Just to follow up on that one as well, after you were drafted by the Sixers tonight, your new head coach, Doc Rivers, was speaking on how much he likes you and he likes a lot of the potential you bring to the floor.  What do you think you can learn from a coach like Doc Rivers? TYRESE MAXEY:   I mean, Coach Doc Rivers is a great coach, a Hall of Fame coach, and that's someone that you listen to.  You listen to the coach and you be extremely coachable because he's not trying to hurt you.  He's trying to help you.  He's trying to help you help the team and be a winning asset to the team.  I just can't wait to get started.  It's going to be a great experience.\"}, 'KJ Martin': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=161037', 'text': \"Q. If you could start out with opening remarks about your style of play and what you'll bring to the Kings. KJ MARTIN:   Right, so starting off I have the 3-and-D role, getting it done on defense 1 through 5. Whatever Coach needs me to do, whatever my teammates need me to do, I'm going to try to get it done for them. On the offensive end, I'm going to be able to stretch the floor and create for my teammates without exactly having the ball in my hands. So just taking stress off the team, pretty much, and being the Energizer Bunny and doing what it takes to win.\"}, 'Nico Mannion': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=161038', 'text': \"Q. Let's start out with an opening statement about what you'll bring to your new team. NICO MANNION:   I mean, I think I've said this a couple times, but I think I shoot the ball well.  I think that's the most consistent thing I've been working on recently. So I think I bring leadership.  I'm a hard worker.  I think I bring that.  I think I'm going to earn the respect of my teammates, and I think I'm going to be able to come in and compete and help the team win, and that's what I want to do. I'm just looking forward to it.  I can't wait to get out there. Q. How much did it help you playing for FIBA about a year ago confidence-wise, and how proud are you of being an Italian and being drafted in the NBA? NICO MANNION:   I'll start off with the Italian.  I'm super proud of it.  I represent my country and actually have a little Italian flag right here on my sleeve.  So I carry that with me pretty much everywhere I go, and that's really who I am. Playing in FIBA really helped me a lot.  It's a different style of basketball, and I was able to adjust to that pretty quickly and kind of tried to pick up some things that I learned out there to incorporate in my game and bring it back here to America. Q. Can you just take me through that moment being drafted and being with your family, your father playing in the NBA?  What was that moment like to finally achieve your dream? NICO MANNION:   Surreal.  You know, when I heard that I got the call and had found out I was getting drafted by Golden State, it was just a rush of emotions because my father was also drafted by Golden State.  Yeah, it's unexplainable.  It's a blessing come true.  It's a great organization, and I'm happy to say I'm a part of it now. Q. And Steve Kerr also played at your former University, University of Arizona.  Has Sean Miller given you any advice going into this draft and potentially playing for Steve Kerr?  What have you heard about Steve Kerr? NICO MANNION:   I mean, I've talked to him before and talked to him recently, and he just seems like a great dude.  I think he runs a clean ship at Golden State, and he's a hard worker, and I think that rubs off on the guys. One thing I'll say about Coach Kerr is it seems like he really has his guys' backs, which really pays off in the long run.  I think the guys that play for him really will go to war for him because they know he has their best interest and will go to bat for them. Q. Arizona has had a big night tonight, you, Josh Green and Zeke all get drafted.  Can you talk about that moment for all three of you guys and how important it is that you all came from Arizona? NICO MANNION:   I mean, yeah, it was a huge night for the program, three guys getting drafted tonight, two of them in the first round, which will be Josh and Zeke.  When those guys got drafted, I felt like I got drafted.  We're brothers, and there's no hatred, there's no envy, I'd say. I'm just as happy for them as I am for myself, and I think they both got drafted into good situations for themselves, so I'm really happy about that, really proud to be a Wildcat. Q. Obviously not only are you a basketball player, you're obviously a basketball fan, so now that you're going to be playing with Steph Curry, multi-time MVP, how does that feel?  Because I'm pretty sure you watched him on TV, and now you're playing with one of the greatest point guards, if not the greatest point guard, that we've ever seen from this generation. NICO MANNION:   That's just another situation that I see that's surreal.  When I found out, that was kind of the first thing I thought of:  I get to learn from Steph.  He's been in the league for a while, like you said, multi-time MVP. I actually got to meet him already.  I played at Steph's camp, so I got to meet him there and kind of get to know him a little bit. But I'm excited, man.  I think the biggest thing for me is I get someone I can really learn from.  He's a vet and one of the best players to ever play.  I'm just going to be like a sponge, trying to soak up as much information from him as I can. Q. What do you think you're bringing to the Warriors, and are you a little bit disappointed to be only the 48th pick? NICO MANNION:   You know, it's not where I wanted to go number-wise, but at the end of the day I think the fit in Golden State is perfect for me.  I think everything happens for a reason, so at the end of the day this is the perfect situation for me. I'm ecstatic.  I'm still at a loss for words.  I've been with my family for the past 30, 40 minutes since I got picked, and I just keep crying, tears, and it's a surreal feeling. Q. Since the season has been over, Zeke said he's improved a heck of a lot, gained some weight, worked a lot on his game.  What did you work on to get prepared for all this? NICO MANNION:   I think the biggest thing for me coming out of college was my size, so I've gained about 12 to 15 pounds.  I came out about 176, 178, and I'm a little over 190. And I think consistency shooting the ball.  I don't think I shot the ball as well as I should have or could have at Arizona, and I've tweaked just two or three little things, and right now I'm shooting the ball better than I ever have. I think a big thing also is the system that Golden State plays.  I think I'll be able to fit right in with that. Q. How is the 48th pick motivation for you that you could be in better position in the NBA Draft, and what are your expectations for next season in the Bay Area? NICO MANNION:   I mean, yeah, being the 48th pick does give me a little chip on my shoulder.  I'd say a little more than a chip.  But I'm just -- I'm lost for words, honestly.  I think next year -- I don't have any expectations going into the season.  I'm just ready to get there and learn and work. I've already talked to Coach Kerr, and he pumped me up even more.  So I'm excited to get there and learn and work as hard as I can and see what we can do next year.\"}, 'Isaiah Joe': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=161040', 'text': \"Q. If you could start out with opening remarks about your style of play and what you'll bring to your new team. ISAIAH JOE:   So what I bring to a team is my shooting ability, my ability to stretch the floor.  I can knock it down from anywhere, any angle, off the catch, off the dribble. I'm a capable ball handler, so if a team needs me to bring the ball down the court at any time, I can do that.  And my IQ, offensively and defensively.  I feel like my defensive versatility is actually really good.  I'm willing to sacrifice my body.  I take a lot of charges.  I average around two charges a game at Arkansas, so I'm willing to do that, and I use my length to my ability.  I think the main thing is my ability to shoot the ball. Q. If you can take me through what's going through your mind right now knowing you got drafted and you're going to be heading to Philly. ISAIAH JOE:   Oh, man, I think it's a lot of emotions in there right now.  Me, all I ever needed was an opportunity.  Now it's time to make the most of it. So Philly is a great system.  They really value my ability.  They value my skill set.  And so now I'm ready to get up there and get ready for the next steps.  We've got a quick turnaround in the season, so we've got to get things going. Q. Have you ever been to Philly, and if so, what are your memories of the city? ISAIAH JOE:   I've never been to Philly.  This will be a whole new experience, and I'm excited for it. Q. Obviously you're going to be on the floor with Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons.  Those guys are All-Stars.  When you're on the floor with them, what are you looking to learn from those guys and what will be your best attribute for them while they do their thing on the floor as well? ISAIAH JOE:   Ben Simmons, he's an aggressive, big guard.  He's really willing to facilitate the basketball.  So I'm really looking forward to playing with him.  And then when he has driving lanes, I'll be out spacing the floor, occupying a defender.  So I really think that will benefit his game a lot. Same for Joel Embiid.  My defender may not be able to help off as much whenever he has the ball in his hands. He can play his game down low or mid range, whatever he needs to do, and if my defender helps off, that works with the inside-out game. I really think our games will complement each other, and I'm looking forward to playing with them. Q. Growing up playing basketball, who are some players that you sort of patterned your game around? (Phone call from Coach Rivers.) Q. How was it hearing from Coach Rivers? ISAIAH JOE:   Oh, man, talking to the coach, Doc Rivers, man, great coach. I've watched a lot of his teams. But back to your question, though, I watched a lot of JJ Redick, Buddy Hield.  I feel like they do a really good job of moving without the ball.  J.J. Redick does a really good job of setting his man up on screens and keeping his movement.  Buddy Hield is really good in transition. I think one thing they do is get their shot off really quick with a limited amount of dribbles, and I see that in my game. I think someone I looked at more in the bubble was Duncan Robinson.  I think he opened a lot of eyes during the bubble, so I started watching his game as well. Q. I'm wondering what went through your head the moment your name was called tonight? ISAIAH JOE:   Oh, man, it was just a lot of emotions were built up waiting.  I think I was nervous and excited at the same time to hear my name.  So once my name was called, I think it was just a sigh of relief that we all had, me and my family. We were just real happy in the moment.  All I was thinking about was I'm just happy a team took a chance on me because that's all I need is a foot in the door.  I know I'm going to make big things happen. I'm going to make my family proud.  I'm going to make myself proud. All thanks goes to God.  Once they called my name, it was just a sigh of relief.  Now it's just the next step.  I've got to get up to Philly and start making things happen. Q. How can you conceptualize everything that's going on in your life right now?  What's it like to pick up the phone and have Doc Rivers at the other end? ISAIAH JOE:   Oh, man, it's amazing.  It was very unexpected.  This is my job now.  Basketball is a game that I love, and playing basketball for a living is just a dream come true. Nonetheless, I've got a lot more things to push for in the future, but it starts here.  This is just the beginning. Q. I wanted to ask what is your first thought playing next to a guy like Ben Simmons, who does a terrific job finding shooters? ISAIAH JOE:   Yeah, I think you hit it right on the nail. His ability to distribute the ball the way he does and he's a willing distributor, but he's also a guy, he can really attack the basket. And so I think me being out on the floor, I'm a guy that he can distribute the ball to, or that's another lane for him to drive because my man is not going to be helping as strong as others will.  So I think our games will complement each other very well. Q. What are your thoughts about your new chapter in Philadelphia?  And also your thoughts on the organization? ISAIAH JOE:   Any team I'm going to, I believe that all of them -- an organization like this that really values me as a person and as a player and my skill set, it heightens it even more, makes me want to work hard because I know at the end of the day we're going to win games.  And that's the goal at the end of the day is just to win as many games as possible and make a run.\"}, 'Elijah Hughes': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=161042', 'text': \"Q. If you could just start out with opening remarks about your style of play and what you'll bring to the Jazz, please. ELIJAH HUGHES:   Yeah, so my style of play is just kind of all-around kind of offensive threat, put the ball on the floor, make plays, making the game easy, quick, one-dribble pull-ups, two-dribble pull-ups, knock down open shots. Just kind of a full offensive threat, a defensive mind who competes and is going to be ready to compete from day one.  I want to show people I can defend, and I want to prove that and lead from day one. Q. Could you believe that this was going to happen eight months ago as you walked off the floor in Greensboro to where you are today?  Can you talk me through the emotions of the last eight months and the last couple hours? ELIJAH HUGHES:   Let me tell you, these last eight months was a roller coaster, to be honest, a lot of up and down, a lot of uncertainty, getting down on myself. But I've got to credit my support system, my family, my friends, they keep me up, my family, my friends, my agent. When you have good people like that around you, it's hard to stay down on yourself.  It's easy for me to get my confidence back, just keep controlling the controllables.  That's been my mindset this whole last eight months. Q. Just wondering what kind of contact you had with the Jazz prior to the Draft? Did you do a workout?  Did you have Zoom interviews?  What was your reaction when you found out that you were headed to Salt Lake City? ELIJAH HUGHES:   Right, you know, I didn't do any workouts with the players, but we had a really good interview session with them, Zoom call, and it went really well, really smooth. My reaction, I was just kind of like, my heart started pumping and I started sweating and I couldn't hold back -- I tried my best to hold back the tears, but it just kind of flowed with it.  I'm still right now kind of shaking, and it's still kind of surreal. Q. Take me through the emotion.  You're sitting in the room with your family, and then did you hear -- did you get a phone call and then did you hear your name?  Take me through all the emotion of when you were actually selected. ELIJAH HUGHES:   Yeah, I was kind of cornered at first, watching the last couple picks in the 30s, and I was kind of just in the corner by myself.  My family got the vibe that I was kind of like, leave me alone.  My family knew what it was. I was sitting there by myself, and my agent called me.  And he said, get ready, get in the seat because you're going to Utah at 39.  After he told me that, my heart stopped.  My heart stopped beating.  I'm not trying to be funny, my heart really stopped beating, and I kind of lost it for a little bit. But I got in the seat, and it just happened, and like I was so -- I'll never forget, I'm still shaking right now.  It's crazy.  I'm probably talking a bit too much, but I'm just super excited, super happy. Q. I've got a question for you in regards to Utah.  Now that you're going to be playing with Donovan Mitchell and Rudy Gobert, what do you look forward to learning from a guy like Donovan Mitchell? ELIJAH HUGHES:   Right.  Off the jump, Donovan Mitchell kind of being an underrated guy going into the league, so his mindset, number one, just trying to pick his brain as much as I can, just pick his brain on the court as well.  He's one of the dynamic scorers now in the NBA, and he's really good at picking his spots.  So just any way I can, try and pick his brain and his position. And a guy like Rudy, he's the rim protector.  He's going to give you everything he's got on defense.  He's developing his offensive game, as well, and I want to be a guy that goes in there ready to learn but also to be myself, put the ball on the floor, make plays and make shots. Q. You talked about the journey you had over these last eight months, that your journey is unique as far as you started at East Carolina and then came to Syracuse.  What's that mean to represent the small area of Beacon, New York, and say, I'm drafted in the NBA? ELIJAH HUGHES:   Man, it's everything.  It's one of the reasons why I work as hard as I work because I kind of want to bring that attitude to this area where I'm from, Beacon, New York, kind of everything is possible.  It doesn't matter where you're from, how big of a town it is, how much hype it has.  You can do anything you want if you put your mind to it. That's kind of been my mindset.  Every rep I'm doing, no matter how tired I am, I just want to push through it and try to make it the best rep possible. Q. Just wondering if you can tell the people of Salt Lake City and Utah something about yourself, not necessarily as a basketball player, just what they can get to know about Elijah Hughes the human being. ELIJAH HUGHES:   I'm a people person.  I love people.  Love meeting people.  A really smiley guy.  I love sneakers.  Anyone who knows me knows that I'm a sneaker fanatic.  I love sneakers. I'm just really like up tempo, good locker room guy, loves to smile, loves to just have a good time but also knows when it's time to be serious and when it's time to compete, and just a laid back dude.  I don't do much.  I'm not a gamer.  I watch a lot of movies, just hang back and chill.  But my biggest thing is just sneakers and fashion for sure. Q. I wanted to ask you what you think of Donovan Mitchell and what you think of being able to play alongside a guy like that and the leadership he brings to a team. ELIJAH HUGHES:   I think Donovan is one of the best players in the league, if you ask me, what he brings, what he can do offensively, even defensively.  It's kind of off the charts. I think what separates him a lot is the chip on his shoulder.  His determination is something that I really, really admire about him, and it's something that I would like to take after him, as well. He came into the league without a lot of hype, overlooked in the draft.  So his mentality is just different, and I've loved him for that ever since.  And he's just been a guy that you kind of had to root for.  You can't not root for Donovan Mitchell.  Again, like I said, it's hard not to root for him.\"}, 'Vernon Carey Jr.': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=161041', 'text': \"Q. Mitch Kupchak talked about how, when he saw you during the season, they thought that you clearly were an NBA prospect, but he was concerned about your conditioning at the time.  It was mentioned that you did a pretty dramatic makeover of your body after the season's over.  Do you mind going through that, what you did? VERNON CAREY:   Yeah, I mean, just after the season, just me hiring a chef.  I felt like that was a part that played a huge role in it and just me working hard on my body over the time that I had, over the time up until the draft today that I had really. Q. How much weight did you lose, and is there anything particular you gave up or changed about your diet? VERNON CAREY:   Yeah, I lost 30 pounds.  I'm at 240 right now.  Nothing really changed, just the proportions that I eat really and just me being more careful and watching what I eat really. Q. At Duke last year, you played with a very good playmaker in Tre Jones, a guy who made the game seem like -- gave you a lot of easy passes.  Now you get LaMelo Ball as one of your teammates.  Have you watched any of his games?  And how excited are you to have a point guard that's coming in with you that loves to distribute the basketball? VERNON CAREY:   I feel like he's one of -- if not the top playmaker in this draft, so just with his IQ level and the way he sees the floor and everything, I feel like it will make it a lot easier on my game for sure. Q. Just wanted to say thanks for joining us and congratulations on being one of the newest Charlotte Hornets.  Can you just talk a little bit about how your excitement for being drafted by the Hornets and just overall this night, what this has meant to you, in essence, being able to stay right here at home? VERNON CAREY:   Yeah, it meant the world to me, just me growing up and this being my lifelong dream.  I'm just super excited.  Just ready to get to work really. Q. Was this the easiest phone call you've had to take from anyone from North Carolina, from UNC guys, Mitch and those guys? VERNON CAREY:   Yeah. Q. Looking around, we touched on LaMelo, but if you look at this Hornets roster, there's not a whole lot of age on this roster.  It's very, very young with guys like Washington and Bridges and Devonte' and so on.  Is there an excitement factor about how you guys will grow and develop and form a solid nucleus in, not just year one, but in the years down the road? VERNON CAREY:   Yeah, just with the young guys, I mean, I can't speak for anybody else that got drafted, but just for me personally, I know I'm going to just follow Miles and P.J. and those type of guys and just soak up all the knowledge I can because they already went through it.  For me personally, I'm definitely just going to be all ears. Q. Vernon, second question for you.  With the 30-plus pounds of weight loss, is that going to help you become quicker?  What do you think about your game is going to become even better now that you're not playing at 270 and you're playing at 240? VERNON CAREY:   Yeah, definitely, me being in better shape is the first thing.  Just me being more mobile.  I feel like those are the two main things, just me being in better shape and just me being more mobile.  That's something I definitely feel like with me dropping 30 pounds, that's definitely a positive from that. Q. How has your dad -- for those who don't know, your father is also a professional athlete.  He played in the NFL for the Miami Dolphins.  How has your father, although different sports, how has he helped you prepare to be a professional athlete? VERNON CAREY:   He can't really tell me anything basketball-wise, but just like the hard work and just like what it takes really from a mindset standpoint.  I just try to carry that within myself and just to apply it on the court -- not only on the court, but as a young man.  So that's the advice he gives me. Q. Just to follow up on that really quickly, as the gentleman mentioned a moment ago, you will be staying in North Carolina.  Not too much of a travel.  How dope is it feel to be able to play for Michael Jordan? VERNON CAREY:   It's crazy.  Just playing under the greatest -- in my opinion, the greatest player to play the game.  Just being able to learn from him and ask him for knowledge.  Not a lot of people get to do that, so I'll just take it all in. Q. Vernon, congratulations on getting drafted.  As far as skill set, who would you say, like players that you watched growing up, watching basketball or currently in the NBA, that you decided, hey, those are some of the intangibles that I have skill-wise? VERNON CAREY:   I mean, I feel like right now guys like Brook Lopez, him being able to stretch the floor, I feel like that's something I could come in and do.  I mean, growing up, I've been watching -- I watched Dirk a lot, Dirk Nowitzki.  Yeah, I watched those type of guys and guys like Anthony Davis right now and Bam, just try to take little parts from their game really. Q. And I do have a piggy-back question:  We're going to have some fun here.  I've got to ask you.  I don't know if you're a video game player now.  Are you excited to be on NBA 2K now, have your actual person in the game?  That's pretty cool, right? VERNON CAREY:   Yeah, I'm a big video game person, so that's pretty cool.  To be able to be in the game like that, I'm definitely excited. Q. Vernon, I know you kind of touched on this about LaMelo, but how do you kind of see your game meshing with this as you both come into the league this year? VERNON CAREY:   Yeah.  I mean, just I feel like it's kind of similar with what I had with Tre [Jones] this past year, to run certain situations, like pick-and-pop or pick-and-rolls.  Just playing basketball really.  I feel like he's the type of player you could just play basketball with.  I feel like I'm just excited to get out there really. Q. First of all, what are your thoughts about next season, because you're going to be in a young group of guys with players like LaMelo, Terry Rozier, P.J. Washington.  How do you think you're going to fit with these players? VERNON CAREY:   Whatever the team needs me to do, I'll do it.  Playing defense, getting rebounds, whatever the team needs me to do, I'm here for.  So it's something I'm looking forward to.\"}, 'James Wiseman': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=161011', 'text': \"Q. Obviously you're very close to Penny, and you've acknowledged that.  I'm wondering, has he given you any advice on how to be successful in this league or any advice on your journey going forward? JAMES WISEMAN:   Really just taking it one day at a time.  I know it's going to be a long process for me, for my career, but I'm truly ready.  I'm just going in there to try to learn as much as possible and stay humble and work hard every day and just win. Q. Just want to talk about the excitement of joining Golden State.  It's something that they've been connected to you for a long time throughout the process.  What are you most looking forward to in terms of playing with Steph, and where do you see yourself fitting in with the team? JAMES WISEMAN:   Just being their guy.  Come in there and learn as much as possible.  Me coming in, great vets, Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, you've got Draymond Green, Marquese Chriss, Kevon Looney, a lot of great guys on that team. So me coming in, just fit in my role, stay humble and be coachable, which I am.  Go in there and work hard, play hard. Really like that fit and that position that I'm in.  It's a great position for me, great fit for me.  I'm just ready to go in there and play my role. Q. Second pick, Golden State; what are your expectations for this season? JAMES WISEMAN:   Just to go in there and learn as much as possible and get better every day with my teammates.  Go in there and work hard every day and compete and win games. For all athletes, our main objective in sports, period, is to win games.  Go in there and win, learn as much as possible and grow as a player. Q. Is winning Rookie of the Year a goal for you, or are you focused on the team's success? JAMES WISEMAN:   I'm focused on success.  I mean, Rookie of the Year is something that I do want on my list, obviously, but I just want to go in there and be the best player I can be. Learn as much as possible, grow as a player and learn under the vets and play my role, and everything will come after that. Q. How does it feel knowing that you're about to get on the court and play basketball once again? JAMES WISEMAN:   Man, it's a great feeling.  This draft process has been the longest for me, so I've just been working on my game.  I've actually been playing pickup games with pros already, so I've been getting a lot of experience.  But really just focusing on myself.  I'm truly ready to play with these great guys. You've got Steve Kerr as a head coach.  Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, a lot of great players on this team. I can't wait to go in there and play my role as a player. Q. I'm sure you look at these guys, you've been a fan of these guys on the Golden State Warriors, but knowing you come into a team that's ready to compete for a championship already in your rookie year, what goes through your mind when you think about that? JAMES WISEMAN:   There is no pressure.  I've been playing this game for a long time.  I've been in winning traditions a lot, especially in Memphis East High School and college as well.  I'm built for it, and I'm ready to go in there and learn and grow my game and just adapt. Q. What do you think is going to make you effective on a team like the Warriors, who are aiming for a championship? JAMES WISEMAN:   Just being able to grow from the guys, learn from the guys.  I'm great at adapting on a team, so I feel very comfortable with that.  I'm ready for it.  I'm preparing for it.  I'm ready to go in there and play my position, play my role. And just having great teammates around me that are going to teach me the game, that are going to help grow my game, I'm ready for that.  I'm just prepared, fully prepared. Q. I wanted to know what your thoughts are on how you've been able to sort of adapt during this pandemic where training and preparing for the draft has kind of been thrown askew and how you feel that bodes for your preparation heading into the season. JAMES WISEMAN:   It was very hard.  It was a lot of adversity, but I just managed to focus on myself and keep working every day, keep working on my game.  Staying humble. And watching tons of film -- even on the Golden State Warriors, watching a lot of film, watching film on teams, period, watching concepts. Just being in college, having a coach like Penny Hardaway and Mike Miller, I was already in an NBA system, so I know a lot of details and concepts within the game. This year has been hard, but I managed to focus on myself and keep working every day, staying humble. Q. I'm curious if there's one thing about your game that fans don't know.  We only saw you play three times in college, and everyone knows your size and wing span and ability to run the court.  Is there anything not known about your game that you think will make an impact in the NBA? JAMES WISEMAN:   I'd say my versatility.  Just being able to space the floor out and being able to knock down shots.  Go in there and just being a high-character guy and uplifting my teammates every day, even in practice and in the game as well. Being a high-character guy and a guy that loves to work hard.  But I'm also a guy that can space out the floor and be able to shoot the ball, which I've been working on this past summer, and just my whole life been working on my jump shot.  So it's gotten way better. Q. How exactly did you get the news that you got selected by the Warriors and your emotions when you got that call?  And when you think about what comes with joining and helps your career to join a group of veterans and not have to walk in and solve all the problems, what kind of a great thing is that? JAMES WISEMAN:   I mean, it's great in terms of my concept because I can be able to learn, be able to grow my game.  Being able to adapt in that type of environment, which I can.  And just going in there and learning, helping grow my game. Why I busted out in tears is because I've been through a lot.  I text my teammates every day in Memphis.  I wanted that moment with my teammates.  Just seeing all that, becoming like a downfall.  Man, I would just have to bust out in tears because I've been through a lot of adversity in my life. But I'm ready to go into Golden State with a great mindset, with a different mindset.  Ready to go in there and learn as much as possible, grow my game and adapt and work my tail off. Q. I've also heard names like David Robinson and Chris Bosh and Chris Webber.  You're getting pretty high praise when you hear those comparisons.  How do you feel about that? JAMES WISEMAN:   Great comparisons because those are great players, potential Hall of Famers or Hall of Famers.  I mean, it's high praise, but I just want to create my own thing, be my own player.  I'm James Wiseman, I'm myself, I'm authentic.  So I'm just going to go in there again, grow and adapt and stay humble and work my tail off every day. Q. How have you been processing the unfortunate news with Klay's injury, and where do you think you and the team go from here if there is a worst-case scenario with that next season? JAMES WISEMAN:   As soon as I saw it, it was kind of down for me emotionally. But as a team we've got his back no matter what, and he's going to be in great recovery. And in terms of my perspective, I just can't wait to go in there and give my great contribution toward the team.  Go in there and learn as much as possible, grow and adapt within that environment and play my position. All praise be to Klay, my teammate.  He's going to be just fine. Q. Can you tell me if you have a relationship with any of your new teammates already?  I know you participated in the Steph Curry elite camp when you were a high school prospect.  Do you know any of them personally, and what do you think of the team that you saw last year and then obviously the five-year run that they had where they made the NBA Finals every year? JAMES WISEMAN:   Yeah, so I have a great relationship with Steph.  Obviously, I went to his camp, so he taught me a lot.  When I was in high school, he taught me a lot about the game of basketball, gave me a lot of information.  I just took a picture with him.  So that's my guy. But really going into this team, it's a great team to be on, especially coming from my position.  I'm ready to go in and grow and adapt and learn as much as possible under great vets.  Work my tail off every day and stay humble and win and compete and give my full effort.\"}, 'Patrick Williams': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=161012', 'text': \"Q. Can you describe how the last couple of weeks went?  Did you go to Chicago?  Were you surprised that the Bulls wanted to talk to you after -- did you ever imagine you'd be going this high? PATRICK WILLIAMS:   I mean, the last few weeks have been busy, I would say.  I did work out for Chicago, and it went well for sure.  But I didn't really think much of it. But I'm just blessed to have this opportunity. Q. I just wanted to ask you about your journey, getting to this point in your career, let alone in your life.  When you reflect back, what would you say has been the biggest life lesson you've learned up to this stage in your life? PATRICK WILLIAMS:   Hard work works.  I mean, you can talk about everything else, but it's all about who's going to get in that gym and who's going to grind. I think that's got me to this point for sure.  Just never giving up, always being in the gym, and having a good support system.  That's been big for me. Q. Are you a deep dish guy?  Did you get your hands on a deep dish? PATRICK WILLIAMS:   Man, I have not, but I've got to try it.  I've got to try it. Q. Just wanted to know your thoughts on Chicago as a whole, what you see the direction of the franchise is going, and who are you most excited to play with on the roster? PATRICK WILLIAMS:   I mean, Chicago definitely has something special being built there with the new front office, and then the guys that they have coming back, it's definitely something special to be built there, and I'm just excited to learn from all of them, Coby White, Zach LaVine, Denzel Valentine, all the guys, I'm just excited to learn from them. Q. On ESPN you said that the dream was not just draft night.  Could you talk a little bit about what the dream for you was and how you see your career fitting in here in Chicago? PATRICK WILLIAMS:   I can't really say too much, but I just know my dreams are bigger than draft night.  I think I'd rather show you what those dreams are rather than tell you right now.  I'm just ready to get to Chicago and get to work on those dreams. Q. What were some of your meetings or interactions like with the Bulls, when you met with Arturas Karnisovas and Marc Eversley? Did you meet with Billy Donovan?  What were those interactions like? PATRICK WILLIAMS:   I worked out for Chicago, and it was just basketball talk, talking about schemes and ways that I play the game and what I see when I'm out there. And then I talked to Billy Donovan on the phone, I would say a couple weeks ago, and that was just more basketball talk about what I expect from the league, what I see when I'm watching games, that type of thing.  A lot of basketball talk. I can definitely tell that the front office is basketball smart.  They know what they're talking about, which not every front office is like that, so I'm blessed to be in Chicago. Q. For yourself, they praise your versatility, they praise your size.  For you coming off the bench most of your college career, how do you feel like your game is going to translate to the NBA level?  Not many people are able to be a top 4 pick and still come off the bench in college, so how do you think your game will translate? PATRICK WILLIAMS:   I think it will translate well for sure.  The more I learn and the more minutes I get under my belt, the more games I get under my belt, I think it'll translate more for sure.  We have a quick turnaround, so when I get to Chicago, I'm excited to learn as much as I can on the court and off the court to make that transition go a little bit smoother or a little bit easier. Q. I know you mentioned some of the Bulls that you're excited to play with.  I know you and Coby White are friendly, have a relationship.  I'm wondering if you've spoken to him or any other players on the team yet and kind of what your expectations are in terms of fitting into Chicago on the court but also off it in that locker room? PATRICK WILLIAMS:   I've definitely talked to Coby a lot, not per se about Chicago, but just about the process, the pre-draft process, what to expect from the NBA.  We've talked I would say every other day since the day I declared for the draft. I mean, he's been a big help.  Just being a rookie last year, just talking about the things that he's went through, the things that he's learned, and just when I get there I'm ready to learn more from him and learn more from the other guys, from the coaching staff. Q. The community that you grew up in was obviously very special to you, the high school program you came from.  What did all that mean to you tonight as you experience this?  And you went right after the Hornets.  Was there ever a thought that they would pick you? PATRICK WILLIAMS:   I mean, there's never really a thought that any team will pick you.  It all comes by surprise for sure. But I mean, I'm blessed to be going to the Bulls.  And you talk about Charlotte, just this whole process, I've been getting texts and DMs, and people in my family are just saying how proud they are of me and how the city had my back, and I'm just ready to represent Charlotte and also the Bulls well. Q. You're coming out of Seminoles basketball, coming out of FSU.  Tallahassee and Chicago are two very different places.  How are you going to adapt, moving from Tallahassee to the city of Chicago, and how does your game adapt from Seminole basketball to Chicago Bulls basketball? PATRICK WILLIAMS:   I think basketball is the easy part because my game is so versatile.  Just coming in, being able to do anything they ask of me.  And then the living part is just something that you've got to roll with.  That goes back to having open ears, listening to the vets or to the guys that have been there before.\"}, 'Devin Vassell': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=161019', 'text': \"Q. I'm based out of here in San Antonio, so the first question is can you take us through your thoughts and being drafted by the Spurs. DEVIN VASSELL:   I think it's an amazing opportunity.  I think it's a blessing.  I think it's a great fit for me with a great coach, great team.  I'm just ready and eager to get going. Q. We've been watching a lot of tape.  We kind of know your deal on the court.  Tell us about Devin Vassell, the person.  What are some of your interests?  What do you like to do off the court? DEVIN VASSELL:   I'm a really humble, chill guy.  Honestly, I'm down to earth.  I think, for me, a lot of people play video games; I don't play video games like that.  I watch film.  I might watch Netflix or just hang out with my friends, go to Top Golf or try to get into golf.  That's been my biggest thing right now. But honestly, it's not too much.  I really just try to focus on my game. Q. I saw some of your earlier comments from the summer on social justice issues.  How cool is it to be joining this team with Coach Popovich, who's one of the most outspoken voices in the NBA community on those issues? DEVIN VASSELL:   It's huge.  It's huge.  I feel like what's going on today in America, you know, we have such a huge platform, and we can -- we're able to help and talk about some of the things and bring up a lot of things that some people just can't.  Some people don't have the media, the voice to. So I think it's huge to be able to be here and with a coach like that who knows how big of a deal it is and really embraces it. Q. Lastly, I know you're a Georgia guy, but have you ever had a breakfast taco? DEVIN VASSELL:   I have not had a breakfast taco, actually.  That sounds pretty good now that you've said it. Q. Devin, congratulations.  You said you're a good fit for this team.  What makes you good fit, and how much knowledge do you have of the talent?  Do you know some of the guys on the team? DEVIN VASSELL:   Yeah, I mean, I don't know the players directly, but I watch a lot of basketball.  So I know there's a lot of great talent, young talent, and great players out there.  I think that for me I just bring defense.  I bring energy and effort.  For me, I feel like at the position that I play, I get on the rebound.  I get on the glass.  I try to get all the loose balls.  I just play with a lot of energy, like tremendous energy, and try to make it contagious for others and for my other teammates. I think that just right away I could bring my defense to the table and could make shots and just fit however.  I feel like I've been tested a lot, and I was never given that star position.  So I've been able to mold and fit to however I need to. Q. They've got a great developmental staff, as you probably know.  How much are you looking forward to working with their shooting coach, Chip Engelland? DEVIN VASSELL:   I'm extremely excited, definitely.  I know they've developed a lot of great players.  They take their time, and of course they know what they're doing.  I'm just excited to work on my shot, just work on all of my game honestly. Q. Devin, first of all, congratulations.  Welcome to San Antonio.  Regarding -- well, it's a two-part question.  My first question is how do you feel and you know, participating in Gregg Popovich's system?  And the second is, are you ready to compete with the other guards already on the team, like Lonnie Walker, as well as [DeMar] DeRozan, pretty much competing with those guys to kind of earn some minutes? DEVIN VASSELL:   Definitely, definitely.  I think that playing against them is going to help me out a lot.  I can learn a lot.  They're great players, and I think that playing against them in practice and learning from them will help me out and will help me to get better, will help me to get minutes on the floor. Like I said, however I can help the team, that's how it is.  So if I need to be the best practice player, I'll be the best practice player.  Like, however I can affect the game, that's how I'm going to do it. Q. Devin, welcome to the Spurs.  First of all, could you just kind of take us through your basketball journey from high school to college and when it sort of became evident to you that the NBA was something that was on your radar. DEVIN VASSELL:   Definitely.  My freshman year, I played on the freshman JV team.  Sophomore year, I played JV and a little bit of varsity.  I was able to get some light on varsity.  One of the players on the team ended up getting in trouble, so I was able to come in and fill their spot, and my play kind of started and had 18.  Then my coach kind of had more trust in me. My junior year, we had a great team, and like I said earlier, I wasn't really that main guy.  I made it work.  I was averaging like 13, but I knew that to get on the court, I was going to have to play defense, play smart, play hard, and that's what I was doing. My senior year, a lot of talent left, and I knew I was going to have to pick it up, and my coach relied on me heavy.  So my work ethic is great, and I think that I picked it up even more knowing that my coach was looking and leaning on me as being that guy.  So I was out there, whether it was blocking shots, getting steals, scoring, like however I could impact the game, that's how I was doing it, and I was trying to help my team win. My senior year, I said to myself, and I said to my parents, that I'm going to go to a college.  I don't know where, but I'm going to go to a college for two years, and I'm going to go into the NBA.  I feel like I always talked about it, and I had trust in myself that it would work out. I always kind of thought that I would make it to the NBA, and it's a blessing being here, but I know that it's hard work, and it's a journey that's just getting started. Q. My second question was the Spurs took that pick kind of down to the wire.  What was that like for you, kind of nerve-racking-wise, to wait out that pick? DEVIN VASSELL:   Yeah, it was definitely crazy.  It was definitely crazy.  Heart was pounding.  Nervous.  My feet were all sweaty and everything.  To hear my name get called was -- it's a feeling that's unimaginable.  Like I can't explain it.  Just kind of all the hard work that I put in, it comes full circle.  I think that, like I said earlier, though, it was a huge moment, but I still got a lot more work to do. Q. Just a real quick question:  What's your preferred position you'd like to play?  And how would you feel about playing some small ball four if you were put into that type of lineup on the Spurs? DEVIN VASSELL:   I think that shooting guard is my ideal position, but I played small forward all through college.  I'm able to adjust.  I think that either way, whatever position they put me in, I'll be able to thrive and flourish, just as long as I'm putting work in and learning. Q. Hey, Devin, curious, did you work out for the Spurs prior to the draft? DEVIN VASSELL:   I did, yes, sir. Q. I'm asking because last week when we talked, I could have sworn that you didn't mention the Spurs as a team you worked out for.  Do you mind taking us through that workout and what that was like for you working out for them and any feedback they might have given you in that workout? DEVIN VASSELL:   Yeah, it was a great workout, probably about 40 minutes of just good work.  I think that I kind of showed all aspects of my game.  I got great feedback from them, and they were talking to me and telling me some of the stuff that I could work on in the next week.  They were impressed, and I just take it as a blessing and a great opportunity for me to even be there in that gym and them wanting to come and see me. Q. Were Pop and R.C. among those in the gym observing you? DEVIN VASSELL:   No, sir. Q. First of all, congratulations on joining the San Antonio Spurs.  How do you feel about joining this team and having Gregg Popovich as your coach?  And how do you feel about moving to San Antonio in less than a month and putting on the Spurs jersey? DEVIN VASSELL:   Well, first, playing for Pop is amazing.  It's a great opportunity.  I think it's going to be great just learning and taking in all the knowledge he has for the game and being able to learn from a great guy and from players on the team. I'm looking forward to going down there, moving down there.  I think it will be a great adjustment.  I've never been down there, but I think that I'll be able to fit in well.  I'm just excited. Q. Congratulations, Devin.  My question for you is about your college teammate, Patrick [Williams].  He was just drafted fourth overall by the Bulls.  I see you smiling.  My question is, when he was -- when you guys were recruiting him and he was coming in, did you ever envision him being a top five draft pick?  And what was it about what he was able to do down in Tallahassee that enabled him to become a top five draft pick? DEVIN VASSELL:   Definitely, definitely.  I mean, when he came in, the first time I seen him play, I thought he could go number one honestly.  He has the talent.  He has the physique.  He has the mindset.  I mean, he's a great overall player, but an even better person.  I think that honestly -- I'm just super excited for him.  When he got drafted, I almost jumped out of my seat.  I was super excited for him.  I just think that he's going to do great out there.  He's ready. When he came in, there was no doubt in my mind that he could be a top five, top three, number one draft pick honestly. Q. The work that he put in, could you just talk about that for a second.  What we didn't see that you guys saw every day. DEVIN VASSELL:   I mean, he was always in the gym, always in the gym.  I'd get into the gym, and he's either just now getting there or just now leaving, or he's in the workout with me.  He goes in, and he works on his shot.  Some people might question if he can shoot, he works on his shot all the time.  He gets to the basket.  I mean, there's weaknesses, of course, but he thrives on getting better at all of them.  He puts in the hours in the gym, and I just see it. Like I said, I have no words for him because I'm just as excited for him as I am for myself.\"}, 'Obi Toppin': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=161014', 'text': \"Q. I know you didn't expect to fall to the Knicks at 8.  Can you take me through the whole emotions of what happened just now and were the Knicks a team you wanted to go to? OBI TOPPIN:   To be honest with you, me hearing my name called is a blessing.  A lot of people dream of this moment.  There's only 60 picks, and I was one of those picks.  Whether I was 1, whether I was 60, I had the God-given blessing to be No. 8, and go to my hometown, which was New York.  Me being in this position is a blessing. Q. What do you think about coach Tom Thibodeau and how do you think you fit on to this roster? OBI TOPPIN:   I learned a lot about Coach through this pandemic.  Basically, I understand he's a defensive coach, and that's one of my biggest things I need to work on.  I feel like having him as my head coach, he's going to make sure that I lock in and make sure that I become great one day. I feel like if I get that defensive scheme down, I'm going to be a really good player one day, a really great player one day.  I feel like everybody in this organization is going to push to help me be great, and I'm glad I'm here. Q. When you think about some of the other young guys on this roster and how you might fit with them, RJ Barrett to start, what do you think about your fit with RJ? OBI TOPPIN:   Yes, sir, I feel like me and RJ are going to be a great duo.  It's going to be like me and Jalen all over again, me and Jalen Crutcher, who I played at Dayton with.  Me and RJ being on the court together, there's going to be a lot of situations where we're going to put people in tough situations like pick-and-roll coverages, knowing I can pick and pop, knowing I can roll to the basket.  And RJ having the IQ and skills he has, I feel like we're going to be a very dynamic duo in the NBA, and we're going prove that this year or this upcoming season. Q. What would you like to achieve for the city and team of New York? OBI TOPPIN:   I want to have a brotherhood.  I want to build the relationship with everybody on the team, and not only the team, the organization, and have a lot of W's.  New York has been down a couple years, and I feel like with the guys they have now, and myself added to that, I feel like we're going to win a lot of games, and we're going to put New York back on the map, for sure. Q. How do you feel that your work ethic got you to this moment, not having a Division I offer coming out of high school and not being highly touted and things of that nature, and now here you are a couple years later in the NBA? OBI TOPPIN:   Yeah, I feel like nothing has came easy for me.  I went through a lot of things growing up, and I feel like through those struggles and through those bad times that I've been through growing up, it's made me the person and player that I am today.  I learned from those experiences on court and off court.  I feel like going through those experiences helped me become who I am today, and I wouldn't change it for anything. Q. And how about coming back home to New York? OBI TOPPIN:   Coming back home to New York is a blessing.  Being able to play in front of all the family and fans out here and in front of my friends, it's a blessing.  I wouldn't change it for the world.  I'm glad I landed where I landed. Q. You've gone through a lot and you mentioned how that's shaped you into the man and player you are today.  Can you elaborate a bit more on all the lessons specifically that you learned throughout this period and how this journey really shaped you into being who you are today? OBI TOPPIN:   Right, so through high school I changed schools a lot.  I was living in Florida, I was living in New York and I went to prep school in Baltimore.  So going through all those challenges, meeting new people, having to adapt to a new city, create new friends, new teammates, I had to go through that. And also me not being able to play my freshman year in college, it was hard going through that.  But at the same time, I had a good group of guys around me to push me to be great. I feel like without those guys being around me, I wouldn't be in the position I am today.  So I'm very grateful for them and can't wait to start my new journey with the Knicks. Q. A lot of downtime.  Who are some of the players you've studied and modeled your game after, and what NBA player is your game kind of similar to or reminds people of? OBI TOPPIN:   I feel like I studied a lot of people through this pandemic.  A lot of Anthony Davis, and that's who I'm trying to mimic my game after.  I feel like Anthony Davis, he has a lot of different tools to his game on the offensive side and defensive side. I understand I need to work a lot on the defensive side to be as efficient as Anthony Davis is.  But I feel like offensively, studying the things he does on and off the court, he's a great player.  I've been watching a lot of his film. A lot of people have been saying that I play like Amar'e Stoudemire.  So I've been seeing how dominant and the hard work he put in through every game and every practice.  Watching those two guys has been helping me throughout this pandemic, and I feel like I got better off of that.\"}, 'Isaiah Stewart': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=161024', 'text': \"Q. If you'd start out with some opening remarks about what you bring to the Blazers. ISAIAH STEWART:   From day one what I bring to the Blazers is my energy, my motor and work ethic, rebounding, loving to play defense and doing all the little things that may not show up in the stat sheet. Q. Just wanted to get your thoughts on playing with someone like Damian Lillard.  Chances are you probably haven't played with someone of that stature in your career just yet.  What do you think you can learn off him?  How can you play off him, and what impact can you make alongside him? ISAIAH STEWART:   I feel like I can learn a lot from Damian Lillard.  He's a great vet.  He's been in this league for a long time.  And coming in, that's a guy whose brain I will be picking 24/7 just because he has so much knowledge about the game, and he's been to a place where I'm trying to go. Q. Who's the first player you want to match up with? ISAIAH STEWART:   It's not really a particular player that runs through my mind.  I'm looking forward to every matchup day in and day out at the highest level now. It's going to be great players in my position every game, so I'm looking forward to every matchup every night. I'm just excited. Q. Who are some of your players that you looked up to as a young player coming up in AAU or different levels of basketball? ISAIAH STEWART:   A lot of guys I watch now are in the league that I compare my game to and take things away are Bam Adebayo and Montrezl Harrell. Q. You know the history of Rochester basketball.  You made it ahead of John Wallace.  You're the highest drafted Rochester native ever.  How does that feel? ISAIAH STEWART:   It feels great.  I'm truly blessed.  I'm giving all the glory to God. Q. Tell us what it was like tonight.  You worked so hard with coach Scott Fitch leading up to this to get a higher spot in the draft.  To go 16th, to go to the Pistons, did you think you were there with Detroit leading up to this?  How close did you feel Detroit was going to be to selecting you and then to know that that was going to be the case at 16? ISAIAH STEWART:   My agent just kept me in tune the whole time, throughout the whole draft, and would just update me and let me know what was going on.  When I heard that Detroit was going to be picking me, I was -- the Portland Trail Blazers were going to be picking me, I was just ecstatic.  I was excited, and I just couldn't explain my emotions. Q. And to have your family there with you, what was that moment like hearing your name with your family around you? ISAIAH STEWART:   It was great.  Family means a lot to me, and they helped me get to where I'm at today.  To have my family around in one of the biggest moments of my life was just great tonight.  It was great to enjoy this night with them, and it's just a great feeling. Q. How much did the fact that the season ended the way it did for you guys and you didn't have a chance to compete in the tournament and get an opportunity to compete at that next level of pressure, how did you feel about that?  What was your emotion about that? ISAIAH STEWART:   I was definitely frustrated not being able to compete in the NCAA Tournament.  As many know, we had a down year at University of Washington, but I have no regrets.  I enjoyed my stay there.  It was great teammates, great coaches, and I learned a lot in my one year there.\"}, 'Jalen Smith': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=161020', 'text': \"Q. Why don't you start off with a statement about what you'll bring to your new team. JALEN SMITH:   Pretty much what I bring to the Phoenix Suns is defensive versatility.  Like I said before, every team has tremendous scorers.  So we have Devin Booker, Chris Paul, Deandre Ayton.  I feel that's where I can make my impact the most, help them create the offense. Q. Just your overall thoughts when you were picked and your reaction, and if you could expand a little bit more on your thoughts on how you fit in, particularly playing with someone like Deandre Ayton down low. JALEN SMITH:   Pretty much once I got drafted by them, it was a surreal moment.  Everything was up in the air because of this year.  It wasn't a traditional draft.  But at the end of the day, the Phoenix Suns would know that I was the best fit for them.  I feel like that's someone I can work with and continue to grow there in Phoenix. Being beside Deandre Ayton is going to be a major thing, just because I always had a dominant big next to me every time I was playing basketball, and I was able to learn from them.  I feel like that's something I can pick at with Deandre Ayton throughout my career. Q. I'm wondering how much contact you had with the Suns in this process and what they kind of talked to you, if they did, about your role here in that regard. JALEN SMITH:   Pretty much throughout this process, they had the in-person workouts with me, and I had two medias with them.  One was with just the scout team, and another was with Monty Williams and James Jones.  They asked me about Maryland and how I evolved over the years. When they came in person, they talked to me about coming into the league, you don't know how you're going to react until you get tested, and just to be ready for everything, and I've got to come ready to work because it's harder to stay than it is to make it.  So that was their main pitch. Q. Just talk about getting to play with Chris Paul.  Obviously you probably grew up watching him as a kid.  What's that feeling like? JALEN SMITH:   It's going to be an amazing feeling.  Growing up in AAU, always playing against his AAU team and him being there, it's going to be surreal being under a top veteran guard like him and just being able to learn from him and pick from him to help me evolve my game. Q. I'm curious with all of this extended draft process that's been so weird for everybody, what are the skills you think you've been able to add or what are you most proud of adding to your game or your body over this period of time? JALEN SMITH:   This whole offseason I've been focusing on getting my lower body strong and just becoming more flexible in the hips and the ankles.  On the court, being able to create for myself and being able to explode with my back to the basket and just extending my three-point range. Q. I noticed you rocked the goggles.  DeAndre Hopkins does that.  Amar'e Stoudemire did that back in the day.  Why do you choose to rock the goggles? JALEN SMITH:   I'm going to continue to do it.  I don't like contacts much, so it's going to be my second substitute. It's the only way I can see on the court, so I have to stick with them. Q. The television cameras there in the draft caught kind of an emotional moment for you after hearing the news that you were a Sun.  Can you take us through the emotions you were feeling and kind of it all bubbling over for you there on television? JALEN SMITH:   It was a crazy feeling.  This whole night coming in I told my family I wasn't going to cry, and they kept telling me you're going to cry, even though I didn't think I would.  Once that moment hit, those tears kept falling. And just lucky to be in this moment, because so many people want this in their lifetime.  Just to be one of those people to get it, there was nothing I could do to stop it. Q. Your freshman year you played with another big that's kind of a little bit like Deandre Ayton, Bruno Fernando.  How comfortable is it for you to be playing in the same type of environment knowing that you played with just as talented a big when you were a freshman?  Does it make it easier for you? JALEN SMITH:   Yeah, it makes it a whole lot easier.  My freshman year Bruno took me under his wing, and I pretty much followed him every step of the way and just continued to learn from him. I feel as though I can do the same with Deandre Ayton. Being able to learn from him, how he got adjusted to the league and just continue to evolve my game and try to mimic some of the things that he does. Q. You're going to be playing with a true shooter and scorer as well in Devin Booker.  What's it going to be like for you in your mind playing with someone who can space the floor that well, not just obviously with Chris Paul coming but a pure shooter? JALEN SMITH:   It's going to be an amazing feeling.  In college, I didn't get to show off a lot of my playmaking skills.  I feel as though coming into the league I'll be able to playmake into his open shot and get a lot more assists off him and rebound and continue to start fast breaks for him for him to get going.\"}, 'Immanuel Quickley': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=161034', 'text': \"Q. What's it like to be reunited with Kenny Payne with the Knicks? IMMANUEL QUICKLEY:   Man, it's unbelievable just because, you know, he was one of those coaches that I felt like really pushed me on and off the floor.  Coach, I call him K.P., he's one of those guys that's going to hold you accountable, make sure you almost try to quit at practice, so the games become easy.  It's really great to reunite with him for me on and off the floor. Q. I just was wondering how you see yourself fitting into this Knicks team.  They obviously have young point guards, Dennis Smith, Frank Ntilikina.  What kind of conversations did you have with the Knicks so far about how you fit in? IMMANUEL QUICKLEY:   I think first it starts off as a person.  You know, they're trying to build an organization where I guess the character side is just as good as the player side. As far as my play, I feel like I fit in great.  I can play on or off the ball.  I feel like I bring shooting immediately.  That's something that I worked on, and just being able to be a great teammate as well.  Trying to learn from older guys, the vets.  Just come in and be that open-minded person that's willing to learn, willing to get better each and every day. Q. Coach Calipari was talking earlier about the path that you took, not being a starter the first couple games, splitting time.  Tell us what that did for you in your two years at Kentucky, the path you took. IMMANUEL QUICKLEY:   It gives me an advantage as far as not having immediate success.  I think that's a culture shock or an experience shock for some people.  They've had success all their life.  When they get to college, it's easy, and they get to the NBA, and it's hard a little bit.  They're not able to deal with adversity. I feel like for me I was able to do that and get through that in Kentucky, so I feel like I can accomplish anything that comes my way. Q. How do you think your game will translate immediately to the NBA level, and do you see yourself as an on-the-ball guard or an off-the-ball guard in the league? IMMANUEL QUICKLEY:   First of all, defensively, I feel like I'm somebody who can guard ones and twos.  I feel like at Kentucky I became one of the better defenders.  I was guarding point guards, wings, threes, sometimes even fours, if the four is like a perimeter player.  So defensively, I feel like I'm really versatile. Then offensively, I feel like I was originally a point guard, then at Kentucky I kind of changed my game to where I could do both.  I feel like a lot of people forgot I was a point guard all my life, I was an McDonald's All-American and things like that.  I feel like I could do either one really well.  And shooting, obviously, is one of my strengths, and I feel like I'll be able to do that well in the league. Q. How do you see yourself -- first off, was New York really a place you wanted to go to?  It seemed like a place where you really got happy when you heard that name, Knicks? IMMANUEL QUICKLEY:   Definitely.  Everybody was celebrating, not only for myself, I was happy to be a Knick, my family was happy.  It was close to home for me.  And obviously the connection with the guys in New York, Coach Kenny Payne, all those guys.  I'm just really grateful for this opportunity.  Ready to get started and also just ready to get to work. Q. What part of your game do you feel you have to work on before the NBA season starts? IMMANUEL QUICKLEY:   I feel like you can never be a complete player, so really just working on all facets of my game.  Really just getting stronger is going to be a big one, finishing around the rim.  Guys are way more athletic, and everybody's athletic in the NBA.  So I think those two things will definitely be a big adjustment for me. Q. Two questions:  One, Coach Cal, very demanding coach, as is Coach Thibs.  Will that translate?  The other is the Knicks have such a proud history, although not recently.  Can you talk about being part of a process which would restore the Knicks to prominence?  Thank you. IMMANUEL QUICKLEY:   Yeah, on Coach Thibs, you know, I'm just really grateful because even on the interview, every interview that I was on, the head coach wasn't there.  So for him to be on the call, I felt like he believed in me.  From what I've heard, he's watched a lot of film on me.  I'm just really happy to be going to an organization where they believe in me.  They've seen me play.  They understand who I am. Then to the point of being in the Knicks culture and trying to develop that culture, I feel like it's kind of what I said earlier, you want to be a great player.  You also want to be a great person.  So just bring both facets of that and try to elevate the culture on and off the floor is going to be big for me. Q. Congratulations.  You mentioned about your hometown briefly, but being that next guy up from the DMV area, what does that mean to you, man? IMMANUEL QUICKLEY:   It was really cool.  Guys like Markelle Fultz.  I know I'm going to miss some of them, but you could go on and on about DMV players.  Just to be another one is really cool.  Obviously, my journey is just getting started.  I haven't done anything yet.  I just got drafted. But continue to stay hungry, continue to stay humble, and continue to just work is something I'm going to try and do as much as possible. Q. You mentioned that Tom Thibodeau was on your Zoom call when you talked to the Knicks and you obviously know Kenny well.  Do you feel like you have a familiarity right away with the club and that could help you as you transition to the league? IMMANUEL QUICKLEY:   Absolutely.  You know, going anywhere, you know, you're just happy to be there.  But going somewhere like the Knicks where I know Coach Kenny Payne, I was with him every single day.  Worked out with him every single day, watched film with him, things like that.  So going somewhere I know and I'm familiar with the coaches, the GM, and things like that, I feel it's definitely an advantage going to a team like that. Q. How big is the motivation for you to play with the Knicks and fight for playoff position maybe?  And also, what are your goals about next season?  Maybe Rookie of the Year trophy is in the back of your mind? IMMANUEL QUICKLEY:   Yeah.  For me, just coming in and being the best player I can be.  If that's winning Rookie of the Year, I feel like just coming in, trying to help the team win, that's the biggest thing, playoffs, all that.  So really just, like I said earlier, come in with an open mindset, try to learn, try to understand the ins and outs, getting a routine, and just trying to pick brain from the vets and things like that to just try to be the best player I can be. Q. Follow-up question to that earlier, talking about Coach Cal.  What was the biggest piece of advice he was able to offer you that prepared you for this next step? IMMANUEL QUICKLEY:   For me, it was more just stay true to who I am, which is keeping God first.  My grind, I feel like he said I was one of the hardest working players he's ever had.  Then also, just being a great person off the floor.  Those three things have really propelled me and gave me confidence on and off the floor. So really just I feel like that's how I was able to lead and be a leader on last year's team, just putting the work in, and my teammates and coaches believed in me.  So those three things.\"}, 'Aleksej Pokusevski': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=161030', 'text': \"Q. What will you bring to your new team? ALEKSEJ POKUSEVSKI:   I know I'm going to bring energy.  Whatever they ask me to do, I'm going to do it 100 percent and work to help the team, whatever that means. Q. Was there a player that you looked up to in your journey here, and if not, who's a player that you're most excited to play against? ALEKSEJ POKUSEVSKI:   Yeah, of course KD, like a new-era player.  [Toni] Kukoc, like an old player.\"}, 'Isaac Okoro': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=161013', 'text': \"Q. Isaac, congratulations.  Just wanted to get your thoughts on how you're going to fit in in Cleveland next to Sexton and Garland, and what do you make of people saying you're the best defensive wing in this draft? ISAAC OKORO:   I feel like I could fit alongside Sexton and Garland by just running the floor, getting in quick buckets, and I feel like I am the best defensive player in this draft.  Like I'm able to switch off one through four and still hold my ground. Q. Isaac, congratulations on your big night, man.  When did you get the sense that the Cavs were truly interested in taking you at No. 5? ISAAC OKORO:   I feel like I had a great workout, a great interview with them.  They also took me out to dinner.  We just had a great conversation.  So I feel like throughout that day, I feel like I had a good sense that they were going to take me. Q. Isaac, I'm calling from Cleveland too.  How do you feel you can help this defense right away?  I mean, they've been last in the league for two years. ISAAC OKORO:   I feel like I could take that challenge of guarding the other team's best player and hopefully trying to slow them down or shutting down the game and just giving our guards time to focus on offense and focus on running the floor. Q. Isaac, as you know, you are the first player of Nigerian origin to be selected in this draft.  How does that make you feel especially considering what your mom said about remembering where you come from? ISAAC OKORO:   It feels great to be the first Nigerian in this draft to be drafted.  It's also just a blessing.  Like you said, my mom always tells me to keep that Nigerian pride.  Even though I wasn't born in Nigeria, I still got Nigerian blood.  So it's just having that on my shoulders. Q. What are your goals about next season?  How excited are you to be part of a team with players like Andre Drummond and Kevin Love? ISAAC OKORO:   I feel like my goal for this year is to help the Cavaliers get back to the playoffs.  Just do anything to help us win and get back to the playoffs. And I feel like I could be great playing alongside Kevin Love and Andre Drummond, knowing that they're veterans.  Just going in there and talking to them, getting advice from them, I feel like that will help me out. Q. Hi, Isaac, congratulations.  You obviously have an existing connection with Cavaliers guard Collin Sexton.  How excited are you to be playing with somebody you already know? ISAAC OKORO:   That's great, going in and we already have that chemistry and that connection.  So I'm just going in and asking him questions about the league and how I can fill my role on the team. Will be a great start for me. Q. The Cavs, one of the positions that they've been really lacking is at the wing, which is where you fill in really well.  Offensively, what about your game do you think that you can bring on that end of the floor to really help just kind of fill that gap for them? ISAAC OKORO:   I feel like just my attacking-the-rim ability, being able to force mismatches and post smaller guards up and take bigger guards off the dribble, and also just my play-making abilities, being able to find open the teammates and being able to get them open shots. Q. How different is it going to be getting ready for the start of this season in just over a month from today?  I mean, especially for rookies this year.  This is a different year, you know. ISAAC OKORO:   Yeah, it's going to be different, but you know, I'm ready for it.  We've had a long time to go into workout mode and get better at our game.  So just coming in right now, I feel like I'm ready for it. Q. Congratulations, Isaac.  What over the course of the last almost a year now, going on a year that you've actually played a game, did you specifically work on to get yourself ready for this NBA Draft?  What specifically did you work on to get yourself ready for the draft? ISAAC OKORO:   I would say I didn't just work on one thing.  I worked on all aspects of my game.  Because I know coming into the NBA, you have to have a polished game.  So I worked on my shooting, strengthening my strengths, just working on my passing, working on slide defense, and just playing pick-up game. Q. Thanks, War Eagle. ISAAC OKORO:   War Eagle.\"}, 'Onyeka Okongwu': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=161015', 'text': \"Q. You're going to a team that of course has Trae Young, John Collins and an experienced bunch of young guys.  Number one, what can you bring to the table in Atlanta?  And number two, what are your thoughts on your former high school teammate LaMelo Ball being drafted? ONYEKA OKONGWU:   Well, today, yeah, I play a lot of defense, so I'm defensive minded.  I love playing defensive.  I anticipate everything.  I know what's going to happen before it even happens, this natural ability I have.  I texted LaMelo today, good luck to wherever you go, you're going be a star.  And he went to Charlotte, man, nothing but class.  And cheers for him over here.  So he's like family to me.  I'm happy for him. Q. What are your thoughts about Coach [Lloyd] Pierce, Trae Young and everything that the Atlanta Hawks are building right now? ONYEKA OKONGWU:   Coach Pierce is a great coach.  I had my meeting with him, seemed like a smart guy, knew what he was doing.  Trae Young is a great guard, All-Star point guard.  Going to be a star for a long time. I'm just ready to build up this young team and help this team win games. Q. What are your thoughts about playing alongside Clint Capela and John Collins?  How do you think your skill set will work along with them? ONYEKA OKONGWU:   You know, for me I feel like I play inside out.  When Clint is in the game, me and him can be in inside out.  When John Collins is in the game, could be inside and me outside.  Me and him can help each other out on both sides of the court, on defense.  We're all great athletes, so we're able to prepare to be ready to play defense. Q. Just wanted to ask you your player comparisons, a lot of people are saying you're similar to Miamiâ€™s Bam Adebayo.  What do you make of those, and how do you see your game fitting in in Atlanta? ONYEKA OKONGWU:   I feel like the Bam comparisons are accurate.  Me and him were similar players coming out of college, and it took him three years to develop into the All-Star he is now. So I feel like with time I could definitely be that type of player through time.  I'm patient, ready to get better and develop my skill set. Q. As an NBA player, what would you like to achieve? ONYEKA OKONGWU:   There's a couple things.  Obviously first and foremost, I want to win a championship.  That should be everyone's goal, to win a championship that everyone wants to win. Myself, I just want to be able to get better, be able to be the best that I can be, continue to work hard, have a great work ethic. Q. Sixth pick, Atlanta Hawks, what are your expectations for the next season? ONYEKA OKONGWU:   Obviously to win.  Obviously we want to be able to make the Playoffs.  I want to be able to be impactful but to go into the East, go to the playoffs.  I want to really help this team out. Q. How will you fit in with Trae Young's style of play, and what do you look forward to the most with joining the Atlanta Hawks? ONYEKA OKONGWU:   Trae Young, he's a great point guard.  He can shoot.  He's a great passer.  He's a very good passer.  I like to move around a lot, so obviously Trae Young is a great passer, can hit me when I'm open, I'm catching them lobs. I'm excited to play with him and looking forward to going to Atlanta and just playing.  I haven't been able to play a lot.  I haven't played in so long, that's why I'm excited for it. Q. Are there any players that you look forward to playing against? ONYEKA OKONGWU:   Obviously my favorite player is LeBron James and Giannis [Antetokounmpo].  I feel like those are the top players in the league, and obviously I want to go up against the Ball brothers.  They were my teammates in high school, so having that friendly battle against them, I'm really looking forward to that.\"}, 'Zeke Nnaji': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=161029', 'text': \"Q. Can you talk about your style of play and what you'll bring to the Nuggets. ZEKE NNAJI:   First and foremost, I want to thank the Most High.  Without Him, I wouldn't be in this position.  He's given me everything, and He's the only reason I'm here.  All glory and honor go unto His name. But I mean, I'm ready.  I'm a worker.  I'm someone who's coachable, who's disciplined, who brings energy.  Yeah, and I'm just excited to be a part of this Nuggets organization. I've been working a lot during these quarantine times, and I feel like I've made a lot of improvements.  I've added 20 pounds of muscle.  I've really improved my jump shot, shooting the three-pointer well.  I feel great.  My body feels explosive.  I feel quick.  I'm just excited to do whatever I can to help our team win. Q. How much contact did you have with the Nuggets prior to tonight, and if you did have any sort of extensive contact, what was your impression of the Nuggets when you met with them? ZEKE NNAJI:   Yeah, I had a couple interviews with them.  I also worked out for them, and I feel like -- I always felt like they were a great team, a team I would like to go to.  I felt like our conversations went really well, and I felt like we built a pretty good relationship from those interviews and from the workout that I had for them, so yeah. Q. The moment you got selected, just take me through the feelings in your household with your mom and dad and going through that moment and achieving your dreams. ZEKE NNAJI:   Yeah, it was an incredible moment.  I'm so thankful first and foremost for the Most High, for all that He's done for me putting me in this position.  I'm extremely blessed, and I know there's so many people that want to be in this position, but for me to be here, me and my family, we're incredibly thankful. It feels great because I've been working to get to the NBA for so long, but I know this is just the beginning.  I know that now the button resets, and it doesn't matter where you're drafted, now it matters how much work you put in. I'm a worker.  I'm ready to work.  I'm going to get better, and I'm just going to let my game do the talking. Yeah, I'm excited to get to work, really. Q. How excited were you to see your teammate Josh Green go to Dallas two picks ahead of you? ZEKE NNAJI:   Man, I was so pumped.  He deserves it.  He's an incredible worker.  He's just a great teammate to have, and to see him go 18 to the Mavericks, I was so happy because I know how hard he's worked for this.  And I've been with him for a while, and he definitely deserved that. Q. I'm just curious, this whole process, obviously the college basketball season stopped in March, you guys as prospects have had a very, very long wait.  How did you kind of stay -- just sort of stay motivated and keep a process through all that and how difficult was that? ZEKE NNAJI:   Yeah, I mean, I didn't find it too difficult to keep myself motivated.  I feel like people have been doubting me since my high school days.  I feel like I have a chip on my shoulder.  There's so many things that motivate me. And this quarantine time I felt like I know it's so unfortunate everything that's happening, and I've had people and family members that have been impacted by this, as well.  But I was trying to make the most of this opportunity.  I know it's a bad situation to be in, but it's also a lot of time to get better. That's what I was doing this whole time, just getting better, putting time in the gym, improving my body, improving my shot.  I feel like I made a lot of big improvements in this time off, and I feel like I'm not going to stop there.  I'm going to keep working and keep trying to push myself to continue to get better. Q. What's your first impression of playing with Nikola Jokic? ZEKE NNAJI:   I'm excited.  He's a superstar.  He's like one of the best centers in the league.  His vision and his passing is incredible.  He's super talented, high IQ.  I'm excited to learn from him and to get to work with him, you know? Q. I was wondering just going back to when you came to Arizona a year ago, nobody thought you'd be a first-round pick.  It sounds like you had a lot of belief in yourself.  Did it really seem more realistic after looking back on it sometimes during last year that you could do this?  And especially tonight it seemed like maybe you even went faster, quicker than people thought in this draft. ZEKE NNAJI:   Yeah, I have confidence in myself because I know the Most High is with me, and He's the one who's provided me with everything.  I have the utmost faith in Him, and that's why I have confidence in my abilities. Going back to last year even when I got to Arizona, I felt one of my goals was to get Freshman of the Year.  I did, and I set my goals high, but I work really hard, so I'm able to set that work towards it. I'm just ready to work hard for the Nuggets.  I'm just so excited.  Yeah, this is just the beginning of this new chapter in my life.  I'm just ready. Q. At Arizona last year you played some of the 4 and 5, and I was wondering at the NBA level what position you think suits you best. ZEKE NNAJI:   I mean, I think that -- I mean, I'm really -- I feel like I'm a really coachable person and a team player, and whatever the coach needs from me, whatever the team needs from me, I'll step up and take on that role. If they need me to play the 4, I'll play the 4.  If they need me to step up and play the 5, I'll play the 5.  I'm just willing to do whatever it takes to win. Q. Growing up or just now watching film on NBA guys, who are some players that you pattern your game around that you watched and studied film on? ZEKE NNAJI:   Yeah, I watched a lot of like -- the players around the league, I feel like there isn't a single specific player that I tried to pattern my game after, but certain parts of their games I tried to implement into my own game.  I don't feel like there's a specific player I tried to emulate their game word for word. Q. I know you're excited just to get on the court, but is there a particular matchup you're looking forward to? ZEKE NNAJI:   No, I'm up for whatever challenge is thrown at me.  I'm a competitor, and I'm going to give it my all no matter who I'm going against.\"}, 'Aaron Nesmith': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=161022', 'text': \"Q. What will you bring to the Celtics? AARON NESMITH:   Shooting, instant floor space, making life easier for those guys who are really heavy creators on offense, like Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, Kemba Walker, just making their life easier; while on the defensive side of the floor being able to contribute with my size and my length and my ability to guard multiple positions. Q. Who would you say you're most excited to play against in the NBA? AARON NESMITH:   Definitely Khris Middleton or LeBron James.  Khris Middleton went to my high school.  He's on the Milwaukee Bucks, which is another title contender in the East.  So that would be fun to be able to play against him and kind of have that moment that I always envisioned since high school. Q. For those who have never seen you play, what is the thing that Celtics fans should be excited about having with you on the roster now, being a part of the Celtics tradition? AARON NESMITH:   You know, an absolute sniper, a guy who's going to make life easier for the creators of the offense, Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, Kemba Walker.  A guy that is always going to be there and work hard and earn his stripes and do it on both sides of the floor. I want to be great.  I want to be the best player I can be, and so that includes defense.  I'm going to give my all and the best effort I have to that side of the floor, and with my size, length and athleticism, being able to guard multiple positions.\"}, 'Jaden McDaniels': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=161028', 'text': \"Q. Congratulations on your journey into the NBA.  What was it like?  What was it like to hear your name called?  When you heard your name called this evening, what was the first thought that went through your mind? JADEN McDANIELS:   Man, it was just a bunch of relief, and then just to have my family next to me, I kind of shed some tears.  It was tears of joy, though.  So it was a great experience. Q. And just to follow up on that really quickly, what was the pre-draft experience like?  Of course I know it was a lot of wondering.  Now that you know exactly where you're going, what do you feel like you can bring to your team? JADEN McDANIELS:   I feel like just going through the pre-draft and working on aspects of my game, just coming in with high energy, being able to play defense at a high level and guard one through four.  And on the offensive end, knocking down open shots, just buying into what the coach wants me to do. Q. How would you feel playing next to Karl-Anthony Towns at the four position guarding larger players? JADEN McDANIELS:   I'll be excited just to have him as like an older guy for me to look up to and just kind of buy off his game and take things from him to help me as a player.  He's a big guy.  He's been there.  He's been in the league for a while.  So try to just be a sponge off of him and just learn different things every day. Q. Have you talked to the coach tonight?  And if so, what did you say?  What did you guys talk about? JADEN McDANIELS:   It was just a brief conversation of them just congratulating me and things like that.  Also saying just coming in ready to work and buying into the system.  For me, it's something that I've always done my whole life, trying to do everything right on the court, just buying in.  So I could do whatever the coach asked me. Q. How do you feel your game will mesh with the likes of D'Angelo Russell and Anthony Edwards? JADEN McDANIELS:   I feel like being a versatile player, being able to handle the ball and stuff, I feel like such different situations -- like I could sometimes be the creator for them or even in opposite ways.  Anthony, we're kind of like the same age, same class, just even taking pieces and growing off of him, and really just D-Lo, and trying to add aspects of my game. Q. Have you been to Minnesota before, and what are your thoughts about going to a state like that if you haven't been before? JADEN McDANIELS:   No, I have not been there before, but just during my pre-draft, I was with a couple Minnesota guys like Daniel Oturu and Tre Jones.  It's super cold.  I'm used to the cold from Seattle.  They say it's a lot of snow.  But I'm kind of excited, just new place, new culture.  This is the start of my journey. Q. I just wanted to ask what it means to see you and your teammate [Isaiah Stewart] make it in the first round tonight.  What does it mean for you being at Washington?  How cool was that for you? JADEN McDANIELS:   It means a lot just because knowing all the adversity that me and Isaiah went through in the season and just knowing this was one of our biggest goals, and the dream to reality.  I'm full of excitement.  I'm proud of Isaiah.  We're just trying to keep the ball going now. Q. How do you think you'd fit in playing alongside Karl-Anthony Towns in that 4-5 spot? JADEN McDANIELS:   I think I fit pretty well.  Being versatile, I feel like I could play one through four at any time.  Kind of like I said earlier, just taking pieces off his game and little tips, even how to guard bigger dudes in the post, and just learn on the pick-and-rolls and stuff.  Lots to learn. Q. What were your conversations like with Minnesota?  And did you have a good idea that they were one of the spots you might land in tonight? JADEN McDANIELS:   You know what's crazy is today is my first time ever talking with the coaches and the GM.  I'm just excited to see them and meet them in person really.\"}, 'Kira Lewis Jr.': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=161016', 'text': 'Q. Hello.  Congratulations, first and foremost.  Just wanted to know what this process was like for you.  How you\\'re feeling about the new team, and how you think you\\'ll fit in with the core they have there. KIRA LEWIS:   The process, it was kind of longer than normal due to the circumstances that was going on, but it gave me time to really work on my game, spend time with my family, just get to do things I normally wouldn\\'t get to do because of basketball. I\\'m just glad that New Orleans picked me.  I feel like I fit in the system well.  Another young player coming in, using my speed.  Getting easy opportunities for other players, as well as creating for myself on a team that wants to compete. Q. You kind of touched on it briefly, but maybe for fans who have not been able to see you display your skills on the court, what can they expect this upcoming season once you get out there to do your thing? KIRA LEWIS:   They can just expect me to come out there and compete as hard as I can, try to bring a lot of excitement to the game, get out, run, play freely, a lot of confidence, and just want to win.  I feel like the fans, when they see me, they will expect me to show a lot of enthusiasm and want to compete. Q. Did you have any meetings with the Pelicans?  Did you talk to David Griffin, Trajan Langdon, Stan Van Gundy?  Just thinking of any interactions you may have had that you believed this could have come to fruition? KIRA LEWIS:   I had a Zoom meeting with them, and they came down to watch me work out.  I had pretty much a conversation with everybody.  I didn\\'t get to have a conversation with Coach Van Gundy, but I\\'m looking forward to it. Q. Hey, Kira.  Obviously, you like to play fast, and you\\'re joining a point guard in Lonzo Ball, who likes to play fast as well.  What\\'s your thoughts on getting the chance to play with him and how you two will mesh on the court? KIRA LEWIS:   Just using our advantage to the best of our abilities.  Really getting out, playing the open floor, feeding off of each other, having another point guard that is dynamic, who can make plays and create for his teammates as well as himself.  I feel like it\\'s going to be a good combination between me and Lonzo. Q. Hey, what did Avery Johnson tell you about New Orleans, and how much have you talked to him about being here? KIRA LEWIS:   We really hadn\\'t talked about it, but since he was from there, he talked about it a lot.  Talked about the food, just how it is as a city.  He really showed his support to New Orleans being from there. I\\'m looking forward to getting down there.  He texted my phone with a couple good spots to eat for my first time being there, so it will be good. Q. I just hopped on.  Apologize if you answered this:  But what kind of contact did you have with the Pelicans in the lead-up to this process, and how much of an indication did you have the days before the draft and today that this was a possibility? KIRA LEWIS:   I would like to say they came to watch me work out.  We had a Zoom.  I feel like I did good in the workout, had a good lunch.  I just feel like I can, like the experts say, with the trade that happened, I feel like it will be a good scenario for me.  So once the time came, I felt very confident New Orleans would pick me, and it happened.  Thank God. Q. How important is it for you, or how thrilled were your parents to know that you\\'re going to be fairly close to home?  Being in New Orleans is, what, five or six hours away.  Were they excited about that? KIRA LEWIS:   They were very excited, driving distance.  My cousin went to school in Louisiana, so it was kind of nothing for us to go watch us play.  Being close to home is an advantage so they can see me play, my sisters, my niece.  It\\'s going to be great.  They\\'re going to be there to support whenever they can come and watch. Q. How much are you looking forward to playing with Zion Williamson and seeing how much you\\'ll be able to feed off each other, the way you talk about Lonzo? KIRA LEWIS:   I look forward to playing with Zion, him getting out in transition, looking for lobs, the athlete he is, how explosive he is.  I feel like with me being a point guard, Zo being a point guard, throwing lobs to him, he\\'s going to feed off of it.  We\\'re going to feed off the excitement it\\'s going to bring to the team.  I feel like it\\'s a match made in heaven with me and Zion playing together, just me with my speed and fast breaking, and him with his athleticism. Q. Yeah, I guess how much have you been following the Pelicans and just seeing the youth movement, what David Griffin has been doing the last few years?  And are you excited to be part of this youth movement that New Orleans is having right now? KIRA LEWIS:   I am extremely excited, just knowing that they play their youth.  I watched them all the time, the young exciting players they have, Brandon Ingram, Zion Williamson, Lonzo Ball.  Very exciting team, and I feel like with me adding a piece of that, we can compete even more. Q. Talk about, if you can, whose game would you say your game is patterned after?  And second question to you is talk about the outfit that you\\'re wearing.  Who influenced the outfit that you\\'re wearing today? KIRA LEWIS:   I try to pattern my game after De\\'Aaron Fox and Lou Will, just as far as speed and the ability we have. As far as my outfit, I have to say my mom.  My family helped me with it.  It\\'s a nice outfit, and the good thing about it is the hat goes with it.  So it\\'s a plus. Q. Kira, how excited are you about your move to the New Orleans Pelicans, and how hungry you are, how big is your motivation to play in this organization? KIRA LEWIS:   I\\'m very excited to play with New Orleans, great organization, up and coming team.  I feel like we can push to the next level.  When I got called, I was very excited because that was one of the teams that I felt like I could come in and help with, just with my abilities.  I just want to go down there and work as hard as I can and show everybody in the league that we can compete as well. Q. I know that, obviously, the University of Alabama has played some big football games in New Orleans.  One of the other questions was about you being so close.  Have you been to New Orleans?  Have you been to a Pelicans game before?  Do you have any memories or stories from being in our city? KIRA LEWIS:   I haven\\'t been to New Orleans, but I have been to Louisiana.  My cousin played at Louisiana Tech.  So I\\'ve been in Louisiana, but I haven\\'t been to New Orleans.  From what I hear about it, it\\'s a great city.  \"You\\'re going to love the people.  It\\'s a good environment to be in.\"  So I can\\'t wait to get down there. Q. The Pelicans have a very loaded backcourt, particularly at the point guard position, with mentors like a George Hill or an Eric Bledsoe, as well as a Lonzo Ball.  Point guard being such a difficult position to transfer from college to the NBA, what are the things you\\'re going to do to pick their brains in making this short transition that you have with training camp starting so quickly? KIRA LEWIS:   Ask as many questions as you can, pick their brains, see how they were when they came in. What they use now to get better in their game. Ask them about the system, certain things they might pick up on that I might not know about.  I have to say coming in, just really ask a lot of questions, work hard off the court, watch film with them, let them sit down and teach you something, a thing or two, and really just build a relationship with them off the court.  You might need help watching film and you might not know something, you just call them. I have to say there\\'s going to be a lot of communication with just picking their brains, watching film, getting exercise and extra reps.  So a lot of that.'}, 'Killian Hayes': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=161023', 'text': \"Q. Killian, congratulations.  A lot is made of the European experience for draft prospects.  What was that like for you, and how did that equip you as a pro when you're entering the NBA? KILLIAN HAYES:   It's definitely hard coming in at 15, 16 years old, playing against grown men, but I learned a lot from it.  Even this season when I started the season slow, but Jaka really trusted me, and we put in a lot of work to be on the court or watching tape.  It really paid off.  During the season we got better and better and better.  Now I understand how to play the game of basketball and how to make the right plays. Q. Welcome to Detroit. KILLIAN HAYES:   I feel great, man.  Thank you. Q. I know Will Bynum worked out with you.  Just you coming to Detroit knowing he was a former Pistons player, did he tell you anything about the franchise?  What was your impressions of the franchise? KILLIAN HAYES:   Just playing hard.  The city loves hard workers.  Bring it all the time, 100 percent on the floor.  Dive for balls, could be anything.  Just give it your all right there. Q. They obviously brought in Troy Weaver.  You guys got all these first-round draft picks coming in as well.  How do you feel as far as starting a new culture in Detroit? KILLIAN HAYES:   I'm excited for it.  I had a lot of talks with Coach [Dwane] Casey and Troy.  I'm ready.  I can't wait for it.  I can't wait to get back on the court, meet everybody, and start getting to work. Q. Killian, congrats on being drafted by the Pistons tonight.  I know a big excitement for you is playing with Sekou [Doumbouya].  Have you and Sekou exchanged any messages?  What's it like having a friend on the team. KILLIAN HAYES:   Yeah, as soon as I got drafted, Sekou sent me the eyes emoji, that's looking away.  I told him in French j'arrive, which means I'm coming.  I see Detroit is making a lot of trades.  I hope he stays in Detroit and everything goes well. Q. Hi, Killian, congratulations.  How does it feel to be the top European pick of this draft?  Deni Avdija was predicted to be the top European for the draft, and now you are.  How does it feel? KILLIAN HAYES:   It's a cool title to hold, but it's not something I was aiming for.  I'm just trying to be in a great situation where I'm able to play and show what I can do. Q. Welcome to Detroit, man.  How much communication did you have with the Pistons?  I know you worked out for them, but were you confident, if you were there at 7, that you were going to be the pick for them? KILLIAN HAYES:   I was pretty confident.  Like everybody knows, nothing is guaranteed.  There was no like 100 percent sure I was going to go to Detroit, but I had a good feeling about it from the meeting that we had, the talk that we had.  Detroit was the team I wanted to go to. Q. I just wanted to know how you feel about playing alongside Derrick Rose, a guy like that, if you can learn from him. KILLIAN HAYES:   I can definitely learn from him.  I remember when I was like 10, 11, watching D. Rose highlights.  I can really learn a lot from him about the game.  He played in the league for a long time now, so he knows the game and how it goes down in the NBA.  So I'm definitely excited to play with him and learn from him. Q. Hello, Killian.  Congrats.  First of all, how hungry you are about next season?  How big is the motivation for you to play with the Detroit Pistons?  Also, you feel ready to set some pick-and-rolls with Blake Griffin? KILLIAN HAYES:   Yeah, man, I'm super excited.  I can't wait for the season to start.  I've been working out for eight straight months, and now I'm just waiting to get back on the court and just show what I can do.  First of all, I'm trying to prove to my teammates and my coaches that they can really trust me.  I'm going to give it my all out on the floor.  And when it comes to game time, we've got to bring out the best in everybody so we can win that game. Playing with Blake, yeah, obviously, Blake is one of the great players in the NBA.  Yeah, off the pick-and-roll, he can do multiple things.  He's got great hands.  He can shoot the ball.  He can catch lobs.  So I'm really excited to play with Blake. Q. Just want to get your thoughts on just joining a team that's in such flux right now.  You mentioned some of the trades that are being made, but you can't really look at the roster and say this guy is going to be there or that guy is not going to be there.  Just joining that and you being a foundational piece of that. KILLIAN HAYES:   I mean, we're building a whole new team.  I want to call to Troy and Coach Casey to talk more about the team.  For now I just want to enjoy the moment, and when it's time to go to Detroit, let's get to work.  We've got to build a team and make sure we're ready to win games. Q. Killian, walk me through the emotions of when Adam Silver comes to the podium and says your name, the emotions, the thoughts running through your head. KILLIAN HAYES:   That was just really -- it's a big relief because in my head I kind of knew it was Detroit, but nothing was guaranteed.  When I heard my name with Detroit, I was really happy.  You could see the reaction of my mom and dad just jumping around.  A lot of excitement.  I felt super proud of myself. Q. Killian, welcome to Detroit.  What would you say is the best part of your game and maybe the part of your game that you need to work on the most? KILLIAN HAYES:   The best part is definitely play-making.  Just making plays for others or making plays for myself.  I love dishing out the ball for easy assists.  I love playing fast in transition.  I just like to make plays. The part that I need to work on is everything, honestly.  I know I have a lot of things to learn about the game.  I played overseas most of my life, so coming in, I know I need to watch a lot of tape, talk with all my teammates about how the game is played.  So just adjusting to the NBA style of basketball. Q. And do you feel some criticism that says you're too much with your left hand, can't go to the right, do you think that's fair, or is that something you just have to work on? KILLIAN HAYES:   That was eight months ago.  I've been working a lot since then.  Right now my right hand is not an issue.  I wouldn't say it's as good as my left, but I can go right at will now.  So I can pass with my right with accuracy, and it's not a problem anymore. Q. Killian, congratulations, and good luck in the NBA.  I have one good question for you here:  I want to know, obviously being a fan of the NBA and now you're going to be playing in the NBA, is there one particular matchup you're going to be excited to like go against a certain player or a player that you may have watched on TV or looked at and studies their game? KILLIAN HAYES:   I'm excited to play against everybody, especially all the great guards.  Curry, Harden, Dame Lillard, Siakam, and all of those guys.  D. Rose, he's one of the great point guards, and he's been in the league for a long time.  So I'm excited to learn from him and also compete against him at practice. Q. Hi, Killian.  I was just curious what you knew about the history of the team and the city and what you're looking forward to when you get here. KILLIAN HAYES:   I mean, everybody knows about the Bad Boys.  In '04 they won the championship.  Will, I trained with Will all last summer, and he came down to Orlando like a month ago.  So we talked a lot about Detroit.  Yeah, he said it's a hard-working city.  So if I get drafted there, just make sure I bring my all every game.\"}, 'Tyrese Haliburton': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=161018', 'text': \"Q. What do you think of the roster for now? TYRESE HALIBURTON:   You know, I love it.  I think I come in early, I'm ready to get to work.  I think we obviously have another great guard in De'Aaron.  I think me and him are going to be really good together, playing alongside him.  And I'm best around shooters, so having guys like Buddy and Bogdan, I think maybe we could be really good.  I'm really looking forward to it. Q. As an NBA player, what are your goals? TYRESE HALIBURTON:   A lot of different things.  I think first and foremost, I want to be Rookie of the Year.  That's 100 percent.  Obviously, there's 11 teams who felt like they had a better option for them, and that's their choice.  I think I'm in the perfect spot.  I love Sacramento, love my fit here.  So Rookie of the Year is most definitely my main goal. Q. I'm just curious if you can share the inspiration with your look tonight. TYRESE HALIBURTON:   Yeah, I think the biggest -- my fashion icon is my dad.  Obviously, I've grown up with him my whole life. Seeing what he wears, I knew I wanted to do something loud but not obnoxious.  I knew everybody was going to go a solid color, or because it's at home might not even wear a suit.  So I wanted to do something I knew nobody else would do or really be able to pull off. This look was perfect for me, and I love the way it turned out. Q. Take us through what you and your family's reaction was watching the draft and seeing your name fall to 12.  There were some people who were surprised by that, but you called Sacramento the perfect spot. TYRESE HALIBURTON:   Yeah, I mean, we were just waiting to see who wanted my services, who saw I was the perfect fit for their organization, and for a while Sacramento has said they thought I was the perfect fit, that I'm one of the best players in the draft. You just want to go somewhere where you're wanted, know what I'm saying?  Obviously, Coach Walton and the rest of Sacramento as an organization, they feel like I am a great fit here, and I feel the same, as well.  I feel like it's the perfect fit. Q. Was it any surprise to you to see yourself tumble that far? TYRESE HALIBURTON:   No, no, not really.  I kind of knew what was going to happen.  I'm not really concerned about it.  I fell to the perfect place.  I'm glad to be a part of the organization. Q. How are you looking forward to the prospect of playing with De'Aaron Fox and the idea of having two lead guards on the court at the same time?  Do you see yourself being able to mesh with him, and how much experience do you have being in that situation? TYRESE HALIBURTON:   Well, if anybody really knows me as a basketball player, they know I work best with another great guard alongside of me, and obviously De'Aaron is one of the great young guards in the NBA today. I think we're the perfect fit for each other.  I think we both just want to play fast, get up and down and push the tempo.  You hear teams talk about wanting to push the tempo, but we're two guys that will push the tempo. I think us two together are the perfect fit.  I think we're both guys who are going to compete hard defensively and score the ball offensively.  I think we're going to work perfect together. Q. How exciting is the idea of having a guy that a lot of people say is the fastest guy in the league playing next to you, then having an option like Buddy Hield on the wing? TYRESE HALIBURTON:   Yeah, I think in Sacramento we do have a great young corps obviously in the backcourt with us three.  I think it's great.  It's the perfect setup for me.  I really am great around shooters, and obviously Buddy is knock-down.  And then being with somebody like De'Aaron, who wants to compete, wants to push the tempo is showing up every game.  I'll fit perfect within us three. Q. How different is this maybe than what you envisioned because of everything that's happened over the course of the year, whether it was the end of the college season or just getting ready for this? TYRESE HALIBURTON:   You know, obviously it's been different.  Life is crazy right now.  But I'm not going to sit up here and complain to you by any means about what's going on. At the end of the day I'm in the NBA.  I know training camp starts in a couple weeks, and I start the season in a month.  For me, I'm not here to complain or anything.  I'm just excited to get to work and compete.  There's obviously other things going on in our world that require a lot more attention right now than the NBA and the game of basketball. I'm just excited and not really thinking about what could have been if I would have been in New York to shake Commissioner Silver's hand.  I'll meet Commissioner Silver one day, so I'm not too worried about it. Q. Do you have any relationships prior with any of the players, coaches before this process, or are you just kind of coming in and trying to figure it out? TYRESE HALIBURTON:   I don't have any prior relationships with anybody in Sacramento, but I'm really looking forward to getting to Sacramento and meeting people and creating long relationships that are going to help us win basketball games. Q. A lot of people have said in this draft that you have the best feel for the game out of any prospect.  It's not something that can be really measured with statistics, but how do you feel about that, and what can you speak to with that? TYRESE HALIBURTON:   Just a high-IQ dude.  I'm a student of the game of basketball.  I love the game of basketball, so I spend a lot of time watching film, doing the little things that some people might not want to take the time to do.  I love the game of basketball, and I'm invested in it with my whole heart. And now that I'm in the NBA, some people think it's a time to be satisfied, but no, I'm ready to get to work.  I want to compete.  I want to win games.  I'm ready to get after it. Q. I'm always curious, what did you know about the city of Sacramento?  And then from the outside perspective as an NBA fan, what did you know about this franchise coming in and looking at the West, how they've done? TYRESE HALIBURTON:   Yeah, to be honest with you, being from Wisconsin, I don't know too much about Sacramento.  But I'm looking forward to learning the place and really calling that place home for the rest of my career hopefully. I'm just ready to get there and get familiar with the city.  I'm from a small town in Wisconsin, so being in California is going to be crazy.  None of my family was ever down there and we're not used to that, so it's going to be cool for us. And just being a fan of the game, I like to think I'm a basketball historian for a 20-year-old.  I know a lot about kind of what's went on, and obviously the early-2000s Kings with Bibby and Stojakovic and C-Webb and Vlade and Doug Christie and how it was a very good team, a team that really competed for a championship and almost was able to get one. And the team Sacramento has now, obviously it's a young corps that's ready to compete, ready to be healthy and be able to truly compete to make the playoffs.  I'm just ready to get to work.\"}, 'Josh Green': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=161026', 'text': \"Q. If you could just start out with a little bit of intro about your game and what you'll bring to your new team. JOSH GREEN:   Yeah, so my name is Josh Green, originally from Sydney, Australia.  I think just coming from the get-go, I think my biggest thing is just going to be able to bring a hard-working atmosphere, being competitive, working, trying to continue to grow as a player.  Learning from the older guys on the team and just bringing everything on the defensive end and doing whatever I can for the team to help the team out. Q. What do you think of the roster of the Dallas Mavericks? JOSH GREEN:   It's awesome.  I think being in a situation like that, it's a lot of international players, so it's awesome.  Watching them play, super unselfish. They've got superstars in Porzingis and Luka.  So just being in that environment and continuing to grow every day, it's awesome. Q. As an NBA player, what are your goals? JOSH GREEN:   Just to continue to get better every day.  I think a lot of players take for granted the draft.  For me, I got drafted; now I want to continue to make my legacy, continue to grow as a player, continue to develop and just learn as much as I can. Q. You mentioned Luka.  I'm curious about what you think about him.  And also you played with Nico Mannion in college.  What do you think about Nico? JOSH GREEN:   Yeah, I mean, first of all, Luka is an amazing player.  Being his age, doing what he's doing, it's awesome.  He's an unselfish and overall just looks like a great teammate. And Nico, I've been lucky enough to be around Nico for five years.  He's awesome.  Nico is a great kid.  Comes from a great family.  Plays very well off the pick-and-roll.  Overall, I wish nothing but the best for him. Q. I wondered how much you knew about the Mavericks, how much you've watched them over the years, or has it just been maybe a recent thing since they got Luka?  And also Rick Carlisle told us a little while ago that they had a really good Zoom call with you a couple weeks ago, and I wondered about your impressions of meeting the Mavericks brass in that way. JOSH GREEN:   Yeah, I've always watched the Mavericks from a young age.  They've always been dominant in the Western Conference.  For me to say that I'm a part of the organization is crazy.  It's an unreal feeling. But my meeting with them, I felt like it was amazing.  They're really down-to-earth, good people.  I just felt like I got along with them very well, and you could tell they take their player development very serious as well as the organization. I was all for it.  I was super pumped, and I loved the Mavericks.  It's something I continued to stress to my agent -- what are the Mavericks thinking, what about this.  So I'm stoked right now. Q. Just talk about the moment of the selection, being with your family and finally making it into the league after working so hard to get there. JOSH GREEN:   It's a star-struck moment.  I think it's one of those moments, you don't know what emotion to really express. For me being with my family, it's awesome.  It's something I dreamed of during my whole entire life.  For it to really happen is amazing.  Obviously, it would have been cool to be in person, but this will never happen again.  So being around my family and my close ones has been amazing for me. Q. Can you give a bit of background about your affiliation with Australia and how that's sort of helped you on this journey and everything that goes into that? JOSH GREEN:   Yeah, I mean, for starters, I'm from Sydney, so I got you on that one, but I feel like I've always loved basketball.  I had to choose between Australian football and basketball.  But for me, I think a big part is just being able to represent Australia. I think I was in a position I never would have thought I would have been in.  So for me to have this opportunity now is just like -- I don't even know how to put it.  It's crazy.  It's unrealistic.  Yeah, words can't describe it. Q. Rick Carlisle described you as a 3-and-D guy.  I'm sure you would describe yourself the same way.  What in your game beyond just defense and three-point shooting, especially with your offensive game, do you see as kind of the next steps for you to take as you head into the NBA as something you can kind of improve and polish? JOSH GREEN:   Yeah, I mean, I think for anybody, they're going to have stuff they need to work on.  But for me, I need to focus on the things the team needs.  I feel like in my position in the role which the team will want me to play, I don't think I need to do anything outside of that. I think if I'm able to play defense, continue to work as hard as I can, hit open shots and do what the team needs to do, I feel like that happens. And as far as the rest of my game, as far as maybe creating a shot, I feel like that comes over time with player development and also respect from your coach. So for me coming to the Mavericks, I want to make sure I'm able to do whatever the team needs to be better and to win a game.\"}, 'Malachi Flynn': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=161035', 'text': \"Q. Would you start out with opening remarks about your game and what you'll bring to the Raptors? MALACHI FLYNN:   I think I'll just bring someone who's a competitor, someone who's willing to work and someone who can bring shooting and playmaking. Q. We just spoke with Bobby Webster, and he spoke highly of your interview process with them.  I'm wondering how you felt about the fit going through that.  Did you see Toronto as a natural landing spot for you with what they look for in guys and the personality match? MALACHI FLYNN:   Yeah, to be honest, I did.  We had some good communication.  They came out to Vegas and watched me work out, and I met some of their staff.  It did feel like it could be a good fit, and here we are today. Q. What was your reaction to being drafted, and how does it feel coming to Toronto? MALACHI FLYNN:   I'm just grateful.  It's a moment I've been waiting for for a long time.  Just enjoying it with my family.  It felt real good. Q. And what do you think of potentially learning from Kyle Lowry and Fred VanVleet, guys in some ways similar to you?  How do you see that fit? MALACHI FLYNN:   I think it's going to be great for me, honestly, as a young guy coming into the league with two guys who have won a championship, who have put up great numbers.  They've won.  There's not much bad you can say about those two guys.  And they're similar size to me, so I think it'll be great for me to just be around them every day and just continue to learn. Q. Just wondering what parts of your game do you think translate the best into the NBA style? MALACHI FLYNN:   I think the ability to shoot the ball.  I think that translates to all levels.  And then as well with that, just the ability to make the right play and take care of the ball, make the right decisions with space.  I think those two will be the biggest thing that will help me translate. Q. Bobby Webster said a few minutes ago that a meeting with you in Vegas really sealed the deal, really vaulted you to the top of their list.  What did you get out of that, and how did you feel it sort of unfolded as the day turned out? MALACHI FLYNN:   Yeah, like I said, they came to watch me work out.  I felt like I had a good workout, but then after just talking to them a little bit, just kind of showing who I am and getting a feel for them, I think it kind of clicked.  And two weeks later they drafted me, so I'm just grateful for it all. Q. I read something about how you studied Fred VanVleet's game and he almost was an inspiration for you.  Can you expand on that? MALACHI FLYNN:   Yeah, I mean, he was someone who played four years in college, and guys like that are usually slept on.  But he ended up even going undrafted.  Then his first couple years he was doing all right, and then he blew up and he just continued to get better.  And he's 6 foot, 6-1, right around there, and guys like that, they get overlooked. Seeing him being able to do it at the highest level, win a championship, put up great numbers in the Finals is definitely inspiration for a guy like me. Q. In that same vein, have you also studied the game of Kyle Lowry, kind of a 6-foot point guard who's kind of reached the top there? MALACHI FLYNN:   Yeah, definitely.  Both of them, they're super savvy.  Kyle Lowry is great at getting you in foul trouble, keeping you on your toes.  He knows what play to make.  He's going to come up in big moments.  He does all the little things. I'm a guy who has watched the Raptors in general, just how well they play.  You're talking about those two guys, those are my position, so I really have paid attention to just the little things they do that contributes to winning.\"}, 'Anthony Edwards': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=161009', 'text': 'Q. Anthony, congratulations, first and foremost, of going Number 1.  How are you feeling, and how do you think you will fit alongside D\\'Angelo Russell and Karl-Anthony Towns in Minnesota. ANTHONY EDWARDS:   I\\'m feeling very joyful and excited just because of the fact I had my mother and my grandmother next to me.  I feel like I\\'m going to fit perfect with those guys because Russell likes to play off the ball sometimes, and I can play on the ball.  When he wants to play on the rock, I can play off the ball.  And KAT is the best three-point shooting big man in the league.  So I feel we can\\'t go wrong with that, a lot of pick-and-pops, pick-and-rolls and such. Q. Congratulations, by the way, man.  We all know what kind of offensive guy you can be.  Can you tell us maybe something that you might want to work on for your NBA game. ANTHONY EDWARDS:   Oh, yeah, most definitely.  Just being locked in the whole game, no matter what\\'s going on, and just proving myself defensively.  Defensively through practice, through workouts, through games, and just going forth in my career, just showing my defensive abilities are unmatched. Q. Yeah, Anthony, congratulations, man.  A lot of people here at Georgia excited for you.  What do you take with you from playing for Coach Crean and Georgia as you head to the NBA now? ANTHONY EDWARDS:   The things that I take with me from playing for Coach Crean, being able to watch film and staying locked in.  Probably the second best thing is just being able to play without the ball -- being able to cut, move, set screens to get other players open, and just being the best teammate that I can be ever. Q. Anthony, congrats on your great night.  Earlier in the week, we spoke to the president of basketball operations at the Timberwolves, and he said that his big target for you was to develop you without the pressure of you having to be a superstar.  Your body is very NBA ready, very athletic.  You can already bring a very explosive game.  How do you expect your development to go in your first rookie season? ANTHONY EDWARDS:   I mean, exactly like he said, don\\'t feel too much pressure.  I\\'ve got two superstars alongside of me, so I\\'m not really going to feel too much pressure. But I\\'m going to do what I always do, bring what I bring to the table, and just impact the game other ways.  They already can score the ball, so defensively I\\'m going to impact the game.  Being the best guard rebounder on the team as I can possibly be, and just being locked in and doing whatever the coach needs me to do, to be honest. Q. Anthony, congrats again, man.  Looking forward to watching you play.  What player would you say are you most excited to play against in the NBA? ANTHONY EDWARDS:   That\\'s easy.  The player I\\'m most excited to play against:  Kevin Durant. Q. Why would you say that? ANTHONY EDWARDS:   Just because he\\'s the best player in the league.  He\\'s 7 feet, unguardable.  He can do everything a little guard can do.  That\\'s easy.  That\\'s who I\\'m ready to play. Q. Anthony, when you hear your name, when you hear it\\'s called Number 1, what are those emotions like maybe versus what you expected? ANTHONY EDWARDS:   Crying-wise, nothing, but as far as just being excited and just being happy and ready to go and ready to work and ready to get there as soon as possible, those emotions were overwhelming with just my mother and grandmother being there.  I mean, it was just a dream come true and just a blessing. Q. Anthony, congratulations on becoming the Number 1 pick in the Draft.  So just getting to this point in your career, the next chapter, when you reflect back on your journey and just all that you\\'ve been through and what you\\'ve been blessed to achieve and everything you\\'ve overcome, what would you say has been the biggest life lesson you\\'ve learned through these respective experiences to this point? ANTHONY EDWARDS:   The biggest life lesson that I\\'ve ever learned was just smile no matter what.  Never get too high, never get too low.  Stay here, stay the course, and just smile no matter what\\'s going on. Q. What does it mean to represent Atlanta as the Number 1 pick, and also give the University of Georgia their first ever Number 1 overall pick? ANTHONY EDWARDS:   I mean, it\\'s a blessing come true.  It\\'s a blessing come true, man, to be from Atlanta, be the Number 1 pick, and go to Georgia and be Georgia\\'s first Number 1 pick and Coach Crean\\'s first Number 1 pick. Everything is just a blessing, man.  Like I say, it\\'s more to come, and I\\'m just ready to get to work. Q. Anthony, I\\'m wondering what were conversations like with Gersson Rosas, Ryan Saunders, and what do you know about the Timberwolves organization and Minnesota in general as you get ready to come up here? ANTHONY EDWARDS:   I just know they like to compete.  They love to compete.  The first time they met with me, they had everything mapped out.  They had a game plan and everything for me.  They were like, listen, they wanted to bring everything and wanted to be ready.  They love to compete.  They love players who come and compete.  They love players who leave it all on the court.  They want you to come in there and just be ready.  I feel like I\\'m one of those players, and I\\'m just ready to work. Q. So I have a question for you:  Right now there are some rumors going around that Ricky Rubio may be traded to the Timberwolves.  So that gives them Ricky Rubio, DeAngelo Russell, and you as a third guard.  How comfortable would you feel playing as a small forward or rotating around those guard roles? ANTHONY EDWARDS:   It doesn\\'t really matter to me because a lot of people don\\'t know, I\\'m 6\\'5\".  I\\'m 230.  So I feel like I can guard one through three.  It doesn\\'t really matter.  I\\'m strong enough to not be pushed around.  So I feel like I\\'m okay. Q. First of all, congratulations.  When you were doing your workouts -- and it took a lot longer than normal since there wasn\\'t the summer for it -- what did you specifically work on to improve to get you to be the Number 1 pick? ANTHONY EDWARDS:   That\\'s a great question, man.  A lot of people don\\'t ask that.  I feel like the most important thing that I changed during my workouts was I was never able to just focus on basketball.  I feel like, once quarantine hit, once I declared for the draft, I was just locked in on just basketball.  Just get one percent better every day.  I feel like the main thing that I changed was just being able to hit consistent shots, like catch and shoot. Not off the dribble.  Everyone is always in awe of what I can do off the dribble, but the question was my catching and shooting ability, which I feel like I took that to another level but not as far as it can go. Q. Congrats, man.  I\\'m also from Atlanta, so knew a lot about you, of course.  I want to ask you, when you went through this quarantine, you talked about it, did you feel like that was -- I shouldn\\'t say an advantage, but kind of like a blessing in a sense, just the fact that you got to work on your game? ANTHONY EDWARDS:   Yeah, most definitely.  A lot of people look at it as it took too long to get drafted.  I look at it as it gave me just enough time to get to where I needed to be right before I needed to report to where I was going.  Therefore, like just me getting in better shape every day, me being able to shoot the ball one percent better every day, me being able to do a lot of things one percent better every day, it changed because of how long of a time period I had.  So I feel like I grew a lot. Q. Quick follow-up:  Knowing that you\\'re going to Minnesota and you\\'re going to this young team, to be in this young nucleus, knowing you all have a lot of talent, how much fun do you think it\\'s going to be and just what are your thoughts in particular? ANTHONY EDWARDS:   It\\'s going to be fun, man.  I feel like we\\'ve got Malik Beasley, Josh Okogie, Jarrett Culver, D\\'Angelo Russell, Karl-Anthony Towns, possibly Ricky Rubio, going to get traded.  It\\'s going to be fun.  We\\'ve got a lot of athletes.  We\\'ve got a lot of scorers.  We\\'ve got a lot of ball players, man.  There\\'s nothing more you can ask for. Thank you so much for having me.  Stay blessed.  Be safe.'}, 'Saddiq Bey': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=161021', 'text': \"Q. What will you bring to the Pistons. SADDIQ BEY:   I'm a big believer in God, so provide the spiritual, provide the faith.  And to try to help my team with whatever is needed.  They believe in me, so I want to help the franchise as much as possible and help in any way possible. Q. You're going to a team with Detroit with guys like Blake Griffin, potentially Christian Wood.  Growing up, did you have a chance to even imagine you'd be playing next to Blake Griffin? SADDIQ BEY:   It would be a great opportunity.  It's an honor and a blessing to be able to play with these guys, man.  I'm just looking to get better, looking to learn from the veterans and try to help the team as much as possible.\"}, 'Desmond Bane': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=161027', 'text': \"Q. If you'd start out with an opening statement about what you'll bring to your new team, please. DESMOND BANE:   You know, I feel like I bring a mature approach.  I bring a mature, consistent approach, both on and off the floor, and I think that'll be beneficial early on. Q. I know you've been waiting for this moment all your life, and just going through your basketball career so far before the NBA, your game is unique.  Who are some guys that you've patterned your game around that you've looked at and studied from to get where you are now? DESMOND BANE:   I like a lot of guys.  I like Joe Harris, Eric Gordon, guys who can shoot, strong bodies, can do multiple things.  I kind of like to model my game after those type of guys. Q. With this team you're going to be on now, what do you feel is best thing you're going to bring to the team, outside of the maturity and some of the intangibles?  What else could you bring to this team to make the next step for this organization? DESMOND BANE:   I feel like it's definitely shooting. Shooting and my willingness to defend.  You know, Ja Morant obviously is a great player and is great at getting in the lane, and Jaren Jackson draws a lot of attention, so being able to spread the floor and being a willing defender I think will be huge for me early on in my career. Q. Is there any player that you're excited to face?  Obviously I'm pretty sure you're excited to face anybody, but is there a particular player that you're excited to face? DESMOND BANE:   I'm excited to play against everybody.  You know, I mean, I'm excited to be in the league and just be an NBA player.  I'm excited to go at guys on both ends of the floor.\"}, 'LaMelo Ball': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=161010', 'text': \"Q. One thing that Mitch Kupchak just talked about that I found interesting is you shouldn't just think of LaMelo as a point guard.  In the way positionless basketball is, considering his height, considering everything else, we're going to find ways to blend him.  He said, Maybe he plays some point forward.  He said, You should not simply think there's a crowd of people playing point guard.  Could you talk about, considering your combination of skills and size, how you think you fit into a basketball team in general that way? LAMELO BALL:   I feel like I fit anywhere real good, and definitely the point forward I feel like could work because it's definitely positionless basketball now.  You can just get in and go.  So Mitch is definitely saying the right stuff. Q. He said that the thing they're most excited about is your ability to push it, because James Borrego has really wanted to increase the pace of this team.  Do you see yourself as somebody who's really good in transition the way they described? LAMELO BALL:   Definitely.  I love transition.  I would love that the team would be in transition, and I feel like it's going to be fun this year. Q. Can you just talk to me about how excited you are to play with a young corps of guys in Miles Bridges, P.J. Washington, Devonte' Graham, that group of guys? LAMELO BALL:   Yeah, I'm definitely excited.  I've been seeing them ever since I was young, for real -- Miles at Michigan State and Huntington Beach.  And then P.J., I played him when he was at Findlay.  It's going to be exciting.  Two high fliers can get out and go.  And we've got a young team, so I feel like it's going to be nice. Q. Do you feel like this team really fits your style of play of wanting to get up and down the court quite a bit? LAMELO BALL:   Yeah, definitely.  I love getting up and down, so if that's the play style, that definitely fits. Q. With a lot of the mock drafts, you were projected to go No. 1 overall.  Was there any surprise at all that you fell to No. 3?  And what are your thoughts that you fell to an organization like the Charlotte Hornets? LAMELO BALL:   I definitely feel great falling into with them.  But the way I've fallen down, I never looked at it like that because, like I say, whatever happens happens, and I feel like it's God's plan.  So wherever he wanted to put me, that's where he put me, and I feel like he's going to let me blossom there. Q. You'll be playing for Michael Jordan, who is obviously considered the GOAT, the greatest of all time, when it comes to the sport of basketball.  Your immediate thoughts about playing for him as your owner? LAMELO BALL:   Man, straight blessing, for real.  I don't even have enough words to say.  I'm just blessed right now, for real. Q. What's it like to be in this moment today, to finally hear your name called?  And then I guess how excited are you to be an NBA player here in two weeks, to get into camp and get going? LAMELO BALL:   Definitely excited.  I'm just letting it all hit me right now.  But like I said, I'm ready to play.  I'm definitely ready to come in and just ready to lace them up. Q. What was the scene like at the draft party?  How many people do you guys there?  What was it like seeing everybody else get excited? LAMELO BALL:   It was beautiful.  It was all downstairs in the room.  The whole room was crying.  I couldn't even tell you how many people there were.  But when they called my name, everybody was cheering, excited.  It was a beautiful scene. Q. You've been a professional before, but Mr. Kupchak said on his call with the media he knows how young you are, there's a lot of room for growth, a lot of potential.  As far as the youth, how are you preparing yourself to adjust to life in the NBA, the spotlight, all of those things, and how do you feel like your previous experiences have prepared you for that? LAMELO BALL:   You just answered it right there.  I feel like these previous experiences made me who I am today.  So it's quite easy, if I'm just talking to you. Q. It's very well known that Charlotte needs their next showtime player.  They need a franchise cornerstone.  How do you feel like you're going to step into that role, and do you think you can fill the arena in Charlotte now? LAMELO BALL:   Yeah, I mean, definitely.  I feel like I can go out there and play basketball.  I feel like I was born to do this.  That's really my answer right there.\"}, 'Deni Avdija': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=161017', 'text': \"Q. I'm just wondering, did you think the Wizards were a possibility coming into tonight, and what was your reaction when you found out you were going to D.C.? DENI AVDIJA:   First of all, everything was open, so I was ready for everything. Any team that was going to choose me, I was ready for it.  I'm super excited for Washington.  It's a great organization.  I'm so glad.  I'm so blessed to get picked by them, and I'm ready to work and to meet everybody. Q. Has anyone told you anything about D.C. that kind you intrigued you about the city, about the team?  Anything you've loved about this franchise over the years? DENI AVDIJA:   First of all, I'm going to start with my agent, my American agent.  He's from D.C., and he always talked great things about D.C.  We were always talking about living next to each other being a possibility, so that was a funny one. I mean, Washington is the capital.  I heard it's a great place, great organization, I'm super excited.  Really I'm blessed and super excited.  That's all. Q. What do you think of the Wizards' roster? DENI AVDIJA:   I think it's very talented.  I'm ready to meet everybody and get straight to work.  Hopefully we can grind and have a good season.  I'm just going to bring the best for the team, and hopefully we can win as many games as we can. Q. What are your goals now as an NBA player? DENI AVDIJA:   First of all, to bring my work ethic from back here.  Just keep improving every day, be a better player every day, help the team as much as I can.  At the end of my career to look at it and say I was the best Deni Avdija I could be, and I don't regret anything.  It's a great journey ahead of me, and I'm super excited. Q. How close was tonight to what you imagined as the first Israeli lottery pick? DENI AVDIJA:   I mean, I didn't imagine that.  It was crazy for me.  Israel is such a small country that doesn't provide as many NBA players as other countries, but for me just to represent my country and to make history, that's a blessing. I have the whole nation behind me.  I hope I'm going to represent well.  I never dreamed about this moment.  I'm thinking it's just still a dream.  I mean, I don't have any words. Q. In what way were Omri Casspi and Gal Mekel role models for you? DENI AVDIJA:   Omri was more in touch with me because we played on the same team.  We would talk a lot about the NBA, about his rookie year in specific, and I wanted to know what can I do best as a rookie and what skills are important to have and how is all the travels and the schedule.  And yeah, we just talked a lot in that season. Q. I imagine your dad has had such a big part in this journey.  What has having him be a professional player been like for you? DENI AVDIJA:   It was great.  It was great to have another competitive spirit in the house.  He was a great player himself, so he had a lot of good things to teach me and teach me how to act on the court, some small tricks maybe in my game that I use that he used, and just how to be a professional, how to work hard, how to have good work ethic, and just always be competitive and just play to win.  That was big for me. Q. Your team in Israel seems to be very popular among NBA players that want to go play overseas.  You are doing it the other way around.  You're coming from Israel to play into the NBA.  How are you going to adapt to the style of play that they have here as opposed to the one you're used to playing in Israel? DENI AVDIJA:   First of all, I think I'm a player that's very easy to adjust.  I'm getting along with everybody.  I always hear what people say to me, always take advice.  I always ask questions to know better and to get better every day. I'm going to stay with the same work ethic.  I'm going to have small changes here and there, that's for sure, but I'm going to have the best environment around me to make sure that I fit and to make sure that I'm getting better and I'm ready for the NBA. Q. How special is it for you to pave the way for the future generations of Israeli-born basketball players in the NBA? DENI AVDIJA:   As much motivation as I can bring to the young players, that's a blessing for me.  I will do everything to promote it.  Hopefully I have the chance after my career for more. I'm just glad that they have somebody to look at and learn and just be motivated and to see that us being a small country doesn't mean that we can't do big things. We did big things, and we're going to keep doing big things, and I'm here to help to everybody.  And to anybody who needs my advice, I'm going to always give it.\"}, 'Cole Anthony': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=161025', 'text': \"Q. Cole, what were your emotions like when you learned the Magic were selecting you? COLE ANTHONY:   I had just a flurry of emotions come out.  I mean, mainly happiness.  I was crying tears of joy.  Shoot, it just tears of joy, it was sadness.  A struggle.  This year was a struggle, I can't even lie.  It was a rough year.  Just literally like every emotion, I went through that in a short period of time. Now it's just sheer bliss, and I'm excited to be part of a great organization. Q. Just a quick question:  Looking forward on how you're moving forward, I know you did have some injuries, but there isn't a Summer League.  How prepared do you feel coming here to Orlando and really being able to understand the NBA side of this game? COLE ANTHONY:   Look, I ain't never been more prepared for a moment in my life.  I'm ready to step up to the NBA.  I'm ready to go.  It's just not a matter of me being cocky.  It's just a matter of I've put in a lot of hard work.  I'm ready to go. Q. I'm also a Tar Heel, so I'm super excited you're coming to Orlando because I get to cover you. COLE ANTHONY:   That's awesome. Q. Cole, congratulations on your selection and congratulations on being taken by the Orlando Magic.  Of course, we know about your father's history in the NBA.  Kind of a two-part question:  Can you talk to me about how your father's mentorship has helped prepare you for this moment?  And can you give us a little information on Spike Lee and how he got involved in what you have going on right now? COLE ANTHONY:   Yeah, first off, my dad is very knowledgeable.  He has a bunch of knowledge about basketball.  He's an 11-year vet.  Still works around the league today.  Speaking of questions for Spike, here he is right here.  They were just talking about you.  My guy. First of all, with my dad, he gave me knowledge.  Just taught me to be my best.  He still works around the game to this day.  Everything I've been through to this point, just to this point. I'm ten times better than he ever was right now. Most of my goals are team goals.  One of my few personal goals is a little competition between my dad where I want to be a better NBA player. Spike is family right there.  I've known him my whole life.  I used to be over at his house when I was a kid.  Me and his kids would hang out, and they were all close to my dad.  So I'm glad they were able to come over here and join in with all of us. Q. Cole, congrats on your big night.  My question is about the movie Little Ballers.  In the movie you were with all these big NBA stars at the time, and now you're not sharing a screen with them.  You're sharing the biggest basketball stage with them.  How does this feel that it kind of came full circle for you, and what are your expectations going into the NBA? COLE ANTHONY:   I really wasn't around the NBA players that much.  There was a few like Amar'e Stoudemire.  I wasn't really around the NBA guys, but just seeing it on the big screen and being associated with them back during that time, when I was a little kid who had that kind of talent.  So being able to get to this point right now and being at the same level as them is exciting. Q. What are your expectations going into the NBA now that you're going to be sharing a big stage with all these people? COLE ANTHONY:   My expectations are it's going to be tough.  Everyone is super skilled.  Everyone is talented.  So it comes down to the little things that separate you.  So I'll try to focus in on those and (inaudible). Q. Cole, congratulations.  Just wanted to get your thoughts.  This is a guard-scoring league, and you can definitely score the ball.  How do you think that you'll immediately impact the league with your ability to put the ball in the basket? COLE ANTHONY:   I'm at a new level, and I'll do what I know I can do.  In terms of what I know I can do on the floor, nothing's going to change.  It's going to be hard.  I'm not expecting anything to be handed to me.  I know I have to work for it. I'll do whatever I can do to prepare myself for that moment. Q. Congratulations, Cole.  It sounds like you were born to be in the NBA.  When you heard your name selected, did it live up to what you expected? COLE ANTHONY:   I mean, these last couple days coming into it, the moment (inaudible).  I treated it like it was a normal day.  I went to the gym this morning, did a few hours of training.  Everything just came full circle.  When they called my name at the last minute, it started to feel real, and that's when all the emotions came out. Q. First, welcome to Orlando.  Glad to have you here.  How do you see yourself fitting in with Markelle Fultz in the backcourt? COLE ANTHONY:   I think Markelle is super, super skilled in his game.  His struggles, I think the worst is behind, and he's going to keep getting better.  We can complement each other. Q. Congratulations, Cole.  Looking at Coach [Steve] Clifford, have you spoken to him, and has he asked you certain things that he would like to see you work on? COLE ANTHONY:   I personally just spoke to him a little bit ago after I got drafted.  I was on the phone with him, and he said he's watched a few of my games.  He said tonight he's going to watch a bunch more of my games and we're going to talk about it tomorrow. We're going to really have an intelligent conversation about my game.  I'm super excited about it. Q. And has Coach [Roy] Williams spoken to you yet? COLE ANTHONY:   I got a call -- he's the first one that called me.  I had a good call with him.  He said he yelled at the screen when he saw my name called.  I'm happy he's happy.  He's my guy. Q. I'm just wondering what your thoughts are on being drafted by Orlando, and what do you know about the Magic? COLE ANTHONY:   I know that -- let's see.  I know that one of my best friends Mo Bamba is there.  He was my best friend.  We played back when I was a freshman in high school.  He's been my best friend since then.  I'm super excited.  Let's see.  Some good pieces.  They've got [Nikola] Vucevic.  Markelle obviously with the ball.  He's very talented.  I've done my research on the team. This is one of my picks I had in the back of my head and thought I hope they pick me.  God is good.  God works in many ways.  This just feels like a moment of truth.  I'm just super excited and happy to be drafted by them.\"}, 'Precious Achiuwa': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=161031', 'text': \"Q. Why don't you start out with a few opening remarks about what you'll bring to the Heat. PRECIOUS ACHIUWA:   First I want to thank God.  I want to thank God for putting me in this type of position where I'm playing for a great organization and able to represent not just myself but where I'm from, my whole country behind me, my whole city. And to play for an organization like the Heat is going to be amazing.  I can't wait to be able to get out there and compete with the rest of my teammates. Q. Precious, the Miami Heat play with a very strong culture, what they call the Miami Heat culture, gritty, strong basketball.  How do you fit into the Heat system that requires this aggressiveness in their game? PRECIOUS ACHIUWA:   I'm a really, really competitive kind of player.  I'm aggressive, too.  I like to play really aggressive.  I'm gritty, too, like you said.  That's what I'm about, being out there doing whatever it takes to win ballgames, and just that aggressiveness, that grittiness and just everything that it takes to win a basketball game. Q. Just wanted your thoughts on if you watched the NBA Finals, and from what you saw, what can you bring to Miami in the hopes of them getting better overall? PRECIOUS ACHIUWA:   Yeah, of course.  I watched the NBA Finals, and thankful they're welcoming me to Miami.  I think I can add a lot to the table, like add a lot of aggression and grittiness to the table and be that support for them inside. Q. What has Coach [Penny] Hardaway taught you to prepare you for this moment? PRECIOUS ACHIUWA:   Just really being able to adjust.  I actually just got off the phone with him.  He was talking about the Miami culture as far as encouraging me to keep that attitude of being able to adjust to situations and always working hard. Q. I'm curious, did you have any indication before tonight that this was going to be where you ended up, or did you kind of find out in real time almost like the rest of us? PRECIOUS ACHIUWA:   I found out in real time.  My hope was to end up in a great organization, and thank God my prayers got answered and I'm part of a great organization. Q. It's been eight years since a Memphis Tiger has been drafted.  You and James going tonight, how does that feel to be a part of that legacy? PRECIOUS ACHIUWA:   I mean, it's just amazing being able to continue that legacy.  Obviously Memphis is a great city, I love that city, and just being able to have my name and be part of that city and that organization is a pleasure. Q. Can I follow up on what you were asked about Coach Hardaway, the system he put in.  Do you feel there's some similarities to the way the NBA plays and how in terms of mental discipline -- also talk about that, what Coach talked to you about. PRECIOUS ACHIUWA:   Yeah, Coach Hardaway has always been big on defense and aggressiveness and just doing the little things to win the game.  Compared to the Miami organization, it's pretty much the same things expected of everyone. And being able to be a part of Penny Hardaway's program, I think it's going to be a lot easier for me to be able to adjust to the next level. Q. Penny was so close to winning a championship.  Did he talk to you about taking advantage of this opportunity and making the most of it? PRECIOUS ACHIUWA:   Yeah, of course.  He's always encouraging me and just telling me just keep working and believing. Q. What was your reaction when you got the call?  Just kind of take us through your emotions when you found out that you were going to be taken at 20, and also, what has been the reaction of your former Memphis teammates? PRECIOUS ACHIUWA:   My teammates have been calling me, blowing up my phone since my name got called, and that just goes to show you that I had guys on the team that we really cared about each other, and me being able to be a part of that program and be teammates with those guys is a blessing. Q. With your Heat workout, what stood out from that workout?  What were your takeaways from that workout, and did you kind of leave there thinking, if I'm there at 20, they're probably going to take me? PRECIOUS ACHIUWA:   Every workout I give it my all, try to do the best of my ability.  After the workout I felt like I put myself in a position to be considered by the Miami Heat.\"}}, 2021: {'Ziaire Williams': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=168252', 'text': \"Q. Ja Morant, that's going to be your teammate.  What do you think about that? ZIAIRE WILLIAMS:   Hey, I know if he throws me the lob, I'm going to go up and get it.  And vice versa -- if he's in the air, I'm going to throw it up and he's going to go get it.  He's an unbelievable talent, super young.  I love the energy that the whole organization has, from the front office, the players, the coaches.  I feel like I can fit in perfectly as a locker room guy and a young rookie just learning and developing and going and fitting into the system.  So I'm super excited to be a part of this organization. Q. What were your interactions with the Grizzlies when you were going through the process?  You mentioned the excitement around the organization, but what were you thinking as far as just coming to Memphis and just being a part of a young core already here with Ja and Jaren (Jackson Jr.) and a couple of guys? ZIAIRE WILLIAMS:   Memphis was always one of my favorites from the start.  I met Zach (Kleiman) at the Combine.  The whole front office, Tayshaun (Prince), everyone, Rich (Cho).  I had a workout with them, an individual.  I did great.  They loved me.  I loved the energy that the whole staff gave.  It was super fun. Like I said, this is the perfect organization I feel like for me.  I'm super excited.  I'm going to give it my all.  I'm going to come in with a learning mentality, a work mentality every day, and I'm not going to take it for granted.  I appreciate the organization for believing in me and the fans, and I'm going to give them my all. Q. What are one or two attributes that you can bring to your team your rookie year coming to the NBA? ZIAIRE WILLIAMS:   First and foremost, versatility.  At 6-9, 6-10, a guy who can space the floor, shoot the three, attack for myself, attack for others, shoot the mid-range.  I feel like I can be a threat at all spaces on the offensive end.  Coming off screens, cutting, doing whatever.  Defense, same way -- switching on screens, guarding guys at my position, smaller guards, maybe bigger players for us.  Versatility, man, honestly, on both ends.  I feel like they need that a lot in my position over there. I'm willing to be as big of an impact as much as possible for their organization. Q. With you going to Memphis, you're also going to the first team that gets to nab a rookie that's been in the Playoffs just this last year.  Is that a dynamic that gives you excitement and challenges you to step up and work even harder knowing you're on a team that just got out of their first playoff run as a young core? ZIAIRE WILLIAMS:   Man, no doubt.  I'm a winner.  I play the game to win.  To come to a team who's right on the edge and has that hunger and the drive to do better, like I said, this is the perfect situation for me.  I'm super excited to have this opportunity.  It's going to be great to just learn from the vets, learn all the hardships that they went through, the highs and lows.  Just come in and work, honestly.  I know this is just the start.  I still have a lot of basketball left and a lot of things to accomplish I think I'm capable of doing.  I'm just being grateful for the moment, seizing the opportunity and just taking advantage of it every day. Q. I know it probably feels like a dream still being in the NBA and stuff, but is there any particular player that you're looking forward to either playing against or with? ZIAIRE WILLIAMS:   Man, just growing up watching the NBA, you want to play against everybody.  It's an honor to play with Ja, with Jaren.  It's a good group in Memphis.  To play against Kevin Durant, LeBron, Devin Booker, all the greats, it's going to be a hell of an experience, for sure.  I'm just now taking it in day by day and just trying to prove to the organization what I can do on the court.  Just taking it day by day.  I'm super thrilled and excited for this opportunity.\"}, 'Franz Wagner': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=168255', 'text': \"Q. What does it feel like to you that you now play with your brother Mo? FRANZ WAGNER:   I mean, I don't know because he's a free agent after this, so technically it's not 100 percent yet.  But we talked on the phone right after I got drafted.  I couldn't really hear him, but he was super excited for me.  I'm really excited, too. Q. Was that your little brother who held the phone to you? FRANZ WAGNER:   No. Q. Who was that? FRANZ WAGNER:   No, that was someone from my agency. Q. But you had the phone and you talked to Mo immediately? FRANZ WAGNER:   Yeah. Q. What time is it in Tokyo? FRANZ WAGNER:   It's about 9:00, maybe 10:00 in the morning. Q. You were surprised by Orlando or you had a feeling before that? FRANZ WAGNER:   I mean, I had a good workout there.  It was kind of in my range, what we thought, me and my agent.  I had a good workout there.  I felt good about it.  But at the end of the day, you never really know until they say your name. Q. Your mom and your dad are here, too, so what does it mean that you have this moment that you can share with them? FRANZ WAGNER:   It means a lot.  For them to come over from Germany -- and my mom has been here for a couple weeks now -- was really cool for me.  This is their second time around at the draft.  I think we were all just as nervous as the first time, but I think we had a good time. Q. You're going to go back to Germany soon or are you just going straight to Orlando? FRANZ WAGNER:   Yeah, I've probably got to go straight to Orlando.  I'm not sure what happens after.  We've got Summer League first.  So yeah, probably not. Q. With the addition of Jalen Suggs and you playing the forward position, this team desperately needs some scoring output.  Are you a pass-first or a decision-maker when it comes to shooting buckets?  What will you bring to the forward position? FRANZ WAGNER:   I think I can score the ball really well.  I also think I can pass really well and make decisions and create for other people.  At least I hope I can do that in the NBA.  I think shooting is going to be really important for me at the next level and showing that I can spread the floor.  I think guys like Cole Anthony or Jalen are great creators off the dribble and for other people. Q. You're also a hell of a defender.  When Jonathan Isaac comes back, with the addition Suggs, Cole Anthony and a healthy Markelle Fultz, how explosive do you think this team can be? FRANZ WAGNER:   Really explosive.  I think those are all really mobile, really athletic players that can guard multiple positions.  At the end of the day, that's what you want.  Hopefully we can get together and play really good defense because I think that's the most important thing when you want to be a successful team. Q. I know today is only day one of your NBA career, but what legacy do you want to leave behind when you finish your career? FRANZ WAGNER:   I want to be known as a great teammate and someone that goes about his business like a professional, comes in early and gets his work done and is never satisfied with himself.  I want to have the same kind of work ethic that I have now, even in 15 years, however my career goes.  I hope I can improve every day and even do that in the next couple years. Q. In your pre-draft process you talked about playing against your brother Mo and you said that playing against him is a pain in the ass.  But now you are teammates with him, so what's that feeling like of getting drafted first of all but now playing alongside your brother? FRANZ WAGNER:   I just said it, I'm pretty sure he's a free agent next season, or at least this offseason.  I would love to play with Mo.  I think we'd have a good chemistry on and off the court and it would be cool just to be with my brother, but I think he's a free agent right now. Q. Obviously you're a German international and of course it's a cliche question, but the great Dirk Nowitzki was the first kind of major European to come over here to the States.  Have you spoken to him in this process at all? FRANZ WAGNER:   I have not.  I have never met with Dirk.  But yeah, he's definitely someone that I really look up to and that has inspired not just me but basically every young German basketball player.\"}, 'Cameron Thomas': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=168264', 'text': \"Q. Can you take us through the process with the Nets throughout the draft process?  Did you work out with them?  Did you meet with them?  Did you think they really liked you? CAMERON THOMAS:   Yeah, I had a workout with them very early in the process.  They loved me and I loved their vibe.  I felt like everything was in place. I kind of like loved them from the get-go with just that one workout I had with them.  And later on we had an interview -- like a week ago we had an interview.  I just felt like it was just a match made in heaven.  All our personalities connected. And with me watching them so much this year, with James Harden being my favorite player, me watching Kyrie, how skilled he is, and KD, I feel like with me coming in and learning from those guys, scoring the ball-wise, it's a match made in heaven.  I can't wait to play with some of my favorite players.  It's crazy. Q. Obviously you've been known as a scorer throughout your career and now you're playing with three of the best scorers of their generation.  How do you look at that adjustment, going from being the guy to kind of fitting in with those three? CAMERON THOMAS:   Yeah, hoopers figure it out, man.  You can never have too much scoring.  I feel like all four of us are hoopers, so we're all going to figure it out eventually.  I'm going to get my shots, and of course they're going to get their shots.  So I feel like I've got to make the most of them because they're going to get them.  I've just got to come in with a great mindset.  I'm actually so happy that I'm here actually.  I feel like it's a great pick. Q. How do you see yourself fitting in with Kevin and Kyrie and James Harden, your favorite player? CAMERON THOMAS:   Yeah, I can just play on the ball if I need to, iso, off ball, running off screens, catch and shoot, anything, playmaking for those guys, getting them the ball.  I just feel like I'm just so complete offensively and an all-around player that coming in I can make an immediate impact with those guys and we can do some great things. Q. I know you said that you are excited to play with your favorite players.  Tell me, what players are you looking forward to going against this NBA season? CAMERON THOMAS:   Honestly, just probably Devin Booker.  He's my other favorite player in the league.  Really my favorite players are on Brooklyn, so just being able to play with them is just surreal.  But Devin Booker is probably the player who I want to go against who's my favorite player outside of Brooklyn. Q. You are a prolific scorer, averaging 23 points a game.  Are there any players from the era before that you grew up watching?  Who was your first player that you saw put the ball in the basket and you said, wow, I want to be able to do that? CAMERON THOMAS:   Kobe, for sure.  Really Kobe everything.  I tried to imitate him.  Tried to imitate everything about him -- his mindset, the way he shot jump shots, his mannerisms, all that, the way he passed the ball.  I tried to imitate everything Kobe did.  Kobe was my first inspiration to basketball. Q. Do you believe that you were selected by the Nets because of your defense or your offensive prowess? CAMERON THOMAS:   I don't know.  I just feel like they picked me because they saw a good player on the board.  So I feel like they just picked me for that reason. Q. You were the last player in the green room.  Were you getting nervous as you saw other guys go and you didn't hear your name called, or you were pretty steady throughout the whole thing? CAMERON THOMAS:   I was pretty steady because I felt like the team I was going to is a championship-level team.  We're going to be winning games.  We're going to be playing for something.  I feel like that is really going to help me out in my rookie year, to have all that experience, all the experience in the game. I was just pretty steady because I knew I was going to a great situation. Q. Do you have any preexisting relationships with anyone on the team? CAMERON THOMAS:   No, not really.  I think Kyrie came and spoke at one of the camps I was at.  I forget which camp it was.  That's probably the only thing I have with him.  With me being on the team now, I can really pick those guys' brains and pick everybody's brain about their rookie year and how -- just different ways of anything.  I can't wait to get to work with those guys.\"}, 'Jalen Suggs': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=168248', 'text': \"Q. They selected Cole Anthony last year.  He averaged 12.9 points per game.  There's a lot of guards already on this team.  What Orlando doesn't have is a lot of stars.  Then there's you, 2019 Mr. Football, 2020 Mr. Basketball.  Do you know the expectations that are on you considering that you're now going to a team who is desperate for a franchise star player? JALEN SUGGS:   I know the expectations I set on myself and those are always the highest.  So going in there and achieving what I set out for myself, I know if I do that it'll meet their standards, as well. Super excited to be going to work with a great group of guards in Cole and R.J. (Hampton) and a great group of people.  Just so excited.  I can't wait to get there with the group. Q. What do you plan to do with the new team?  How do you plan to make a difference? JALEN SUGGS:   Whatever is asked.  Whatever is needed.  Whether that's to guard and score, whether that's to come out and facilitate if somebody else is having a hot night, or shut down a star player on the other team.  I feel like my versatility I'm going to bring in will allow us to do a lot of different things as a team and succeed, because at the end of the day I just want to win.  I want to win for myself, for the city, for the franchise and for everybody else on the team. Q. You're going to Orlando and you have a new head coach in Jamahl Mosley, and you being a rookie and also having a rookie head coach, how do you feel about getting ready to pretty much be a young guy on the team, and what are your expectations on knowing that you have a rookie head coach coming in? JALEN SUGGS:   Just ready to work together honestly.  Knowing that we're both new, new to what we're doing, new to the league in our positions.  Excited to work together.  Excited to see what we can create together, and knowing that -- coming in as a guard and trying to be a leader, trying to be an extension of him in the locker room, on the court, to make things as easy and helpful for him as possible in his transition. Q. What is your long-term goal for your NBA basketball career?  What is that one thing that you want to achieve and look back on and say, I really did that? JALEN SUGGS:   A champion and a contributing role on a championship team.  That's it for me.  That's the peak of the mountaintop, being able to have a parade with the city, everyone on the team celebrating together.  Thinking about that just brings me happiness and gets me excited.  For me, that's the peak of the mountaintop. Q. On the broadcast they were saying that you needed to work on your three-point shot.  I found that funny for a guy who hit a big shot in college like you did.  What do you feel you need to work on yourself? JALEN SUGGS:   You know, I don't think I have a real weakness.  I think I'm really good at everything.  I think now it just comes down to perfecting everything and getting to an elite level at those key things. I mean, just excited to grow, get better.  In this pre-draft process already I've gotten more consistent with my jump shot, handle.  This is the best I've ever felt hooping.  Just excited to get to work.  The sky's the limit for me, and I believe and I know can get there. Q. I know today is only day one of your NBA career, but what legacy do you want to leave behind when your career is all said and done? JALEN SUGGS:   Again, a winner.  Somebody who did everything for their team, gave everything every time they stepped out on the floor.  If you say that about me, that's it for me.  Going along with that, it's playing well, of course, but personal accolades have never really been a driving factor for me.  It's all been winning.  I'm a competitor, and that's what I love to do.  So a champion and playing at the highest level. Q. You're coming from Gonzaga where you almost went undefeated and you're coming into a situation that is more on the rebuild side of things.  How do you plan on handling that your first season? JALEN SUGGS:   With open arms and enthusiasm and energy, bringing in the vibes that I bring and the leadership that I bring and my work ethic and potential.  I'm looking to bring that into the whole team, elevate everybody.  They'll make me better and help me learn.  So really just excited. Q. How did it feel walking up there tonight representing Gonzaga on that stage? JALEN SUGGS:   Amazing.  I loved all my time at Gonzaga.  I'm thankful for everybody who was a part of that -- staff, fans, everybody on the team.  Man, knowing that I made that transition from Gonzaga and they helped me grow as a player and as a person, I can't be more thankful.  So it was great to represent them walking across the stage. Q. What was your reaction when you saw or heard that Suni Lee won the All-Around, and how cool is it two kids from St. Paul achieved such great things on one day? JALEN SUGGS:   I texted her immediately and I sent the videos because I was tuned in.  What a great accomplishment for her.  I'm so proud of her.  Me and Suni are great friends.  To see her do that and now I get to come out and do this, it's amazing.  Minnesota sports and athletics is on the rise, and there's two great examples in one day. Q. Talk about just being picked as high as you are.  If you look back in the history of Minnesota sports, it's been a long time.  Kevin McHale being picked in 1980.  What do you think this means for the kids growing up now watching you play? JALEN SUGGS:   Just showing them that it's possible.  Showing them that through the hard work, the dedication, the faithfulness to perfect your craft that you can get here at the highest level.  I'm a perfect example of it, coming from not much and just a hardworking, dedicated family.  To this point, it's amazing.  So I'm just hoping that every kid back home sees it, recognizes that it's possible and goes and works for it if that's what they want.\"}, 'Alperen Sengun': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=168256', 'text': \"Q.

Can you describe your passing skills at 6-10 when you're double-teamed inside the paint? ALPEREN SENGUN:   My passing abilities, skills before me shooting the ball, I think I will get through this and I think I will be okay and will be better on doing that. Q. You were drafted by the Oklahoma City Thunder but you'll be going to Houston.  Do you see yourself having a dynamic with Wood down low as a presence?  And what international flavor can you bring the city of Houston? ALPEREN SENGUN:   As an international player, I would like to prove the European basketball style in Houston, in the team, as the other international players have been proving.  And as a dynamic, I will be a very good fit in my new team because I'm a good fit and I can get (along) well with everything and everyone. Q. Have you been able to speak with Houston?  I know they just traded for you, but have you been able to have any conversations with them, and how soon do you expect to be in Houston?

So you\\'re headed to the Golden State Warriors, you may play alongside some great talent immediately.  What do you look to take off of guys like Steph Curry and the vets that are on your team and implement that kind of stuff into your game? MOSES MOODY:   I couldn\\'t even, I don\\'t even know what all them are going to teach me because I know they have so many small little tricks and nuances to get an advantage on the other team, but given how great they are, how great the team is, I mean in that environment I have no choice but to get better. Q. How do you feel about going to the Warriors where there is a championship-like team already right now? How does that change your mindset and how you look to develop there quickly? MOSES MOODY:   I\\'m extremely excited.  I like to play obviously on winning teams and to win games and that team can really do it.  I\\'m just glad to be a part of a winning program.'}, 'Evan Mobley': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=168247', 'text': \"Q. With the Cavs also having Jarrett Allen on their roster, what do you see as the fit between the two of you and what could you learn from him at the center position? EVAN MOBLEY:   Jarrett Allen is a great player.  I feel like I can learn a lot from him.  He's been in the league for a while, so me and him, I feel like we can definitely do damage in the league in this coming season. Q. What were your thoughts and feelings when you heard your name called with the third pick?  What was that moment like for you? EVAN MOBLEY:   I was in shock.  Like, I really made it; like, I'm here.  I've just got to continue what I'm doing, keep staying in the gym and keep getting better. Q. What was going through your head today as you arrived here and just kind of seeing this all -- being in person but kind of realizing that it is your draft day? What was your thoughts and feelings about the day and kind of leading up to this moment? EVAN MOBLEY:   It was like a roller coaster.  Sometimes I've got like this burst of excitement and stuff because I knew it was draft day, and then sometimes I was chilling.  Most of the time, though, I was super excited, especially on the way over here, and then seeing the whole arena and everything, all the energy in the arena, it was crazy. Q. I want to ask you, for anybody that wants to get familiar with your game, compare yourself to maybe an NBA player or a couple players.  Who does your game resemble as far as that goes? EVAN MOBLEY:   A lot of people have been comparing me to Chris Bosh, Anthony Davis, Giannis, players like that.  I definitely just see a good amount of similarities between all of those players.  But I feel like I'm my own player and I have my own tendencies, which makes me unique. Q. How do you plan on taking the Cleveland Cavaliers closer to that next championship?  It's been a while. EVAN MOBLEY:   I'm just here to do my best, bring everything that I've got to this city, to the team, get to know everyone.  I feel like we definitely can have a great year this next coming year. Q. How did growing up alongside your brother, playing basketball with your brother, add to your motivation in playing the game? EVAN MOBLEY:   It added a lot of motivation.  Me and him, we were both top players growing up.  He would get his accolades, I would get mine.  So it was just kind of like competition. It just motivated us more and more to keep getting better. Q. With their young core of Darius Garland, Collin Sexton, Isaac Okoro at the moment, what do you see from them that you can add -- what do you bring that you can add to that young core? EVAN MOBLEY:   Just another young player that can run with them.  A lot of them are young athletes, fast.  I'm fast.  I'm an athlete.  So I feel like that whole entire lineup, also with Jarrett Allen, we can definitely shock a lot of teams and get out and run a lot. Q. The name of the game is obviously versatility, but when people look at you as being a 7-footer they're probably thinking center.  What is it about your skill set that you feel isn't apt to being a 7-footer and what you can show at the pro level that maybe you weren't able to at USC? EVAN MOBLEY:   I feel like my guard skills and ball handling, a lot of 7-footers don't have, as well as my shooting.  Those few attributes are some attributes that most 7-footers don't have and more guards I would say have.  Those skills I definitely feel like are some strong attributes that not a lot of big guys such as me have. Q. Your potential assists were a number that a lot of us have noticed while studying your game, while getting to know you better in the Cleveland media.  Being able to play with Darius Garland and Collin Sexton, do you think you're going to be able to show off your playmaking ability at the next level? EVAN MOBLEY:   Yeah, definitely.  Especially with the floor opened up even more, I definitely feel like I can show off my playmaking ability even more, as well as with those shooters.  They're going to knock them down.  So I'm going to just be trying to make the best plays possible. Q. With Cleveland hosting All-Star this year, is that a goal of yours as a rookie to make the All-Star team? EVAN MOBLEY:   Yeah, it's definitely a goal.  I'm trying to get everything. Q. When you look back at your freshman year at USC and just the growth that you had in multiple areas, where did you see yourself grow the most that is the most beneficial coming into the league? EVAN MOBLEY:   I feel like I was more of a dominant player.  On that team I had to be more of a scorer, more a focal point on the team, so I feel like that whole dynamic developed with me very well during that whole entire season. Q. Also with your dad as an assistant coach at USC, obviously watching you play basketball growing up when you were younger and being a coach for you at USC and him being here tonight, what is that relationship like between the two of you and how special is it for him to be here with you through this whole process? EVAN MOBLEY:   It's great because he's been there since day one all the way up, coaching me.  Now he's coaching me at USC, and then now he's here on draft night.  He's been with me the whole night, and it's really special.\"}, 'Davion Mitchell': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=168254', 'text': \"Q. I know today's only day one of you coming into the NBA, but what legacy do you want to leave behind when it's all said and done? DAVION MITCHELL:   I just want to just leave that I can be a guy who can just be a winner.  That's kind of just been my calling card, just doing the things that win, known as a winning person and also a better person off the court. Q. I had a chance to ask you this question back during the NCAA tournament.  People around the country, including your teammates, had always said you were the guy that it came to when it comes to learning things here and there and your game has grown and developed over the last years at Baylor.  But what have you learned and what have you grown from your game since the last time you stepped on court with a Baylor jersey on to the hat that you put on right now?  What have you worked on the most since then? DAVION MITCHELL:   Yeah, just being a pro.  Being around all those guys, also at the gym I was working out at, doing the little things like getting in the hot tub, ice tub, taking care of your body.  Learning those things.  You can't really, you got to think about it's 82 games, it's not college no more, so you got to be available so things like that and just being a pro, eating right, little things like that. Q. What can you bring to the Kings?  For Kings fans who have never seen you play, what can you bring to the table, and what should Kings fans look forward to? DAVION MITCHELL:   Definitely just being a dog on the floor.  Guarding everyone, making it hard on them and also play-making ability and just knocking down shots, things like that. Q. You basically just said it:  You want to be a dog on the floor.  You didn't go to offense when you actually said that; you went straight to defense.  You want to see the next person that you're going to guard.  Can you talk about your defensive skills, your defensive mindset and how will that translate working with the Kings? DAVION MITCHELL:   That's just kind of been my calling card.  I just love to win and I just really just do what it takes to win, and that's defense.  Defense wins championships.  So, bringing that to the Kings will definitely help their organization just because I can be a dog on the floor, offense and defense. Q. How do you measure your defensive skills?  Is it a natural thing, is it something that you just work on, did you spend a lot of time looking at film on how to defend guys?  What's that thought process? DAVION MITCHELL:   It's kind of all things.  Watching film is definitely important and especially with guarding one of their best players, always guarding the best players on the team, so you kind of got to watch film.  You can't just go out there with a blind mindset.  So, just watching film, and some of it is natural with my hands.  I have really quick hands.  Moving my feet, I love getting on their guards.  So, it's kind of all those things. Q. Who is probably one of your best instructors as far as teaching you the defensive sets? DAVION MITCHELL:   Defensive sets?  I really don't have one.  I mean, I can't really think of one.  I'm kind of the guy that watches the film.  I kind of do that on my own. Q. What were your conversations like with the Kings building up to the draft, and how have they said they sort of envision you with this team? DAVION MITCHELL:   I didn't speak much with them but I'm guessing that playing with De'Aaron Fox and Tyrese Halliburton, a young backcourt, also a backcourt that can get out and run, make plays for each other, and just playing together. Q. They were one of the worst defensive teams in the league last year.  Just how can you step in and instantly help on that side of the court? DAVION MITCHELL:   Like I said before, disrupting the ball, being a coach on the floor.  Everybody wants to win a championship so they got to, you got to be able to play defense to win championships, so I think that the Kings have what it takes. Q. What did your time at Baylor help you with to prepare for this moment and what do you want to say to Baylor fans that supported you? DAVION MITCHELL:   Just want to shout out to Baylor, thank you for bringing me in, from Auburn.  I mean, it's been an amazing feeling just to be there.  I think Baylor's just taught me just put others first before yourself and that's kind of been our motto, enjoy teaching others and yourself and I live by it.  It brought us together and it brought us a National Championship and it's brought me here.\"}, 'Jonathan Kuminga': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=168253', 'text': \"Q. You're playing with the Warriors but how will you use your physical capability, your power inside of that Warriors lineup on offense? JONATHAN KUMINGA:   I'm in a great situation.  I see myself as giving out a lot on defense and at the end of the day if they need me on offense, it's just the way they want me to do it, I'm willing to do it and I feel like I'm capable to do it.  I feel like it's the right fit for me. Q. Like Jalen Green, you both got better as the draft approached through G League Ignite.  How do you see the future for players who take the same route going to the G League?  And you also had one teammate in the Ignite.  His name is Kai Sotto, he's from the Philippines.  Do you think Kai can be where you are, making an NBA team? JONATHAN KUMINGA:   Kai for sure, he has a chance to be a great player.  At the end of the day Kai works hard, he has the size and ability to be an NBA player and drive. And just going to the G League, I feel like that's the best route to go out there and just work hard every single day. Q. I know today is only day one of your NBA career, but what legacy do you want to leave behind when your career is all said and done? JONATHAN KUMINGA:   At the end of the day I just want to be remembered as that guy who brought a team to a championship, who won a championship.  At the end of the day I want to be Hall of Fame, so I want to have a great career where everybody going to be talking about I want to model my game to Jonathan at some point. Q. The Warriors are obviously in a position to really kind of compete for a title next season.  How ready do you think you are to kind of step in and play maybe like a supplementary role on a winning team like right now? JONATHAN KUMINGA:   Like I said, I always thank God, I always pray to God and I was lucky to be in this position, and I feel like that's the type of competition I'm looking forward to.  As long as I grow around Steph Curry, Klay, Draymond Green, I feel like my game is going to go from the bottom to the top in a couple months.  As I get along and get used to them people, because they're going to always push me, they're always going to put me in the right situation, and I feel like no matter wherever we end up, we're ready to compete and win a championship. Q. I'm sure you're aware a bunch of African players were drafted last season and one of them I think even won the title with the Milwaukee Bucks.  So, when you look at that progression and you look at the great African players that have come before you, where do you think your ceiling is and which African player do you think inspires you the most? JONATHAN KUMINGA:   I would say pretty much all of them.  Starting from [Dikembe] Mutombo, going to Giannis who just won a championship, you know.  I want to be in that category.  I want to be one of those players where coming from Africa and one day do something big in the NBA. So basically I'm looking forward to going to Golden State and help the team and just be that one African kid thatâ€™s going to come out there and do everything that I can do to help a team to win. Q. During this process and maybe even over the past year since you were based a little bit in Northern California with the Ignite, had you had any conversations with the Warriors with Bob Myers, Steve Kerr throughout this process?  Did you have an idea that maybe this could be a possibility, you going and playing for the Warriors? JONATHAN KUMINGA:   No, you know, I didn't have any idea.  Golden State is just a team -- it's a good team and just me being selected at Golden State I feel like it's the perfect fit for me and I'm really excited to be a part of it.  But going through my Ignite career I never get to talk to anybody, but one thing I'm just surprised and really like looking forward for is like I'm used to the city so it's basically going back home again. Q. Did you talk to Bob Myers or Steve Kerr over the past couple of weeks during the pre-draft process? JONATHAN KUMINGA:   I didn't talk to Steve Kerr, but I talked to like the owner of the team, because they came in town and I had a workout and we had a dinner and stuff and it went well. Q. Could you tell us a little bit more about that workout in Miami with the Warriors, what specifically were you able to do for them and what was the interview process like with them that day? JONATHAN KUMINGA:   I would say the day I worked out they came and watched me it went really good.  I showed all the ability that I'm capable of doing, all the little things that I'm capable to bring to the table and help the team to win.  So, I think just from that, that's where they really picked me.  And we went to dinner and it went really good, they had a great staff, they came out to see me and I enjoyed the time I had with them. Q. You're a prospect that has one of the highest ceilings in the draft, potentially out of this world.  How do you want to unlock that and make the Warriors right about their draft pick? So what area of your game do you want to attack first and make sure you have that down before you step on a NBA court? JONATHAN KUMINGA:   Pretty much everything.  At the end of the day, like I said, I have the most and the highest ceiling in this draft and it's just my work ethic that I put every day, I'm working on pretty much everything, I don't work on one thing.  So, basically going to Golden State it's like I'm already prepared, because I'm not going to be, I'm not going to be the man of the team, but at the end of the day I'm going to be one of the players on the team that's going to help the team to win. Q. How do you think your training will be affected by playing with Klay, Steph and Draymond?  You're going to have a lot of time to work on your game, you won't be asked to carry the load at first, so how are you going to attack that for your training behind the scenes where you're not going to be able to use it in the game right off the bat? JONATHAN KUMINGA:   I just got to bring it out for every time I get in the game.  I just got to be the player they need me to be, listen, learn every single day, work hard and I think everything will go well.\"}, 'Corey Kispert': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=168257', 'text': \"Q. What was kind of the lead-up to tonight like for you and how did you find out that you were going to be the pick? COREY KISPERT:   Yeah, well, I just came from DC to start with, like I flew in to New York from DC, I'm going to head right back.  Just got a text or my agent got a text and kind of let me know about a pick ahead and spent all that time kind of thinking about what life will be like for me in a Wizards uniform. Q. Apologies if this has been asked already, just what do you think about reuniting with Rui Hachimura?  I understand he's pretty excited that you were just drafted? COREY KISPERT:   Rui's my guy.  Spent a lot of really good time playing with Rui and developing a friendship with him.  So, to be able to spend a little bit more time with him and play with him professionally is really, really cool. Q. This has been quite a journey for you.  How does it feel to be in this moment after four years of hard work at Gonzaga to get to this time? COREY KISPERT:   Yeah, you said it, it's just so much hard work and so much failure and trying again and failure and trying again, and sticking to it and kind of making games slowly and surely and it's been a long process.  But every bit of it was worth it.  So, I'm really ecstatic, I'm over the moon about the way it turned out. Q. Last year you dabbled with this, went back to Gonzaga for one more year with this being your goal.  Just, I guess, what's the last year been like for you to now see it be rewarded after all this work? COREY KISPERT:   Yeah, it makes it all worth it.  So much hard work especially last year, a lot of resilience, trying to see the big picture when the immediate was so tough, and every single day and every single time I was in the gym is all worth it now, and I'm just so happy to be here. Q. You said that you thought that the Wizards were a good fit for you, that the front office really kind of valued a player like you.  What specifically about the Wizards did you like most? COREY KISPERT:   Yeah, especially just playing with Brad, to be honest.  Having a guy like that who is so elite with the ball in his hands, I can create driving lanes for him.  I can move pieces around and play off of him and make plays when he doesn't or can't. So, I'm so excited to play with a player like that of his caliber and the front office clearly sees that, too and really believes in the kind of player that I can be. Q. With the Summer League not too far away, just a couple weeks away, are you looking forward to going to the Summer League and what are some of your goals for your rookie year? COREY KISPERT:   Absolutely.  I spent a few summers as a kid watching Summer League and Summer League games and they stick in my mind, they're a lot of fun and they're really cool from the fans' perspective, so I can imagine they're just that much better from a players' [perspective].  So, I'm looking forward to that and I expect really big things out of my rookie year.  I expect to jump in and not skip a beat.  I want to help Washington win and continue the push that they started at the end of last season. Q. How does it feel -- I mean, I know you're coming from an already loaded Gonzaga team, how does it feel to be able to slide in with an All-Star like Bradley Beal? COREY KISPERT:   It's perfect.  I can't wait to play with him and I can't wait to learn from him, too.  I want to be a sponge and I want to be someone who just learns and grows and continues to be better and learning from a guy like that will help me do it.\"}, 'Kai Jones': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=168262', 'text': \"Q. You came from Texas, a university that is known for big men.  A lot of big men that you have to lean on in the league.  You've got Myles Turner, Jarrett Allen, just fantastic defenders.  What is it like to carry on the tradition of Texas and the expectations of being a big man drafted so high out of Texas? KAI JONES:   It's a blessing.  University of Texas is a first-class school.  We work really hard there.  Coach has held us bigs to a standard every time we come through.  So it's a huge blessing.  I know some of the guys who are already in the NBA.  I have a relationship with them.  It's going to be huge for me moving forward, just being able to talk to them about their experiences, learn from them and compete against them, too. Q. You're going to be playing with LaMelo Ball.  How exciting is that for you?  And who are you most excited to match up against potentially? KAI JONES:   Playing with LaMelo Ball is going to be super dope.  He can pass the ball, he's a good point guard, he can score, he can pass.  Seems like a good guy to be around.  And I'm most excited to play against Kevin Durant, seeing that he went to UT, he's a forward, can really score.  I'd like to see what my defense looks like against him. Q. How excited are you to finally be in the league? KAI JONES:   Man, I'm super excited.  It's a huge blessing.  Many people from the Bahamas don't get to be in this position, so I'm really excited, man.  I'm super blessed. Q. Obviously the fit was kind of the talk of Twitter.  They saw the flamingos inside.  Tell us a bit about the suit? KAI JONES:   This is a custom-made suit.  I got it tailored in L.A. by a company, Elevee.  The pink is for flamingos, obviously.  I like this shirt; it's silky soft.  I have some straw shoes on. And then these cufflinks are custom, too; they've got my initials on them.  They're super dope.  I love my suit. Q. Just talk about your meeting with them a few weeks ago. KAI JONES:   When I went to workouts the first time, it was really good.  I got to show them just my all-around game, hitting threes, a really good workout.  I showed them what I could do.  Then that second workout, when they brought me back again, that was one of the best workouts I had during the pre-draft process.  I went super hard.  I knew it was my last workout.  I really gave it my all, shot the ball really well, got to show my handling ability and athleticism.  So it was really good.  I had a really good workout with them.\"}, 'Jalen Johnson': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=168261', 'text': \"Q. I wanted to ask you, have you had any previous conversations with the Hawks before tonight, and if so, could you share some of what you guys talked about? JALEN JOHNSON:   You know, I had a conversation with them at the NBA Combine.  Other than that, I didn't work out for them.  The conversation, general conversation, good conversation, I remember that, us just talking about a lot of things.  But other than that, nothing too much. Q. Who do you kind of pattern your game after?  Who would you compare yourself to league-wide? JALEN JOHNSON:   Jalen Johnson now, I'm in the league now, so that's who I compare myself to.  But there's a lot of guys I looked up to, of course LeBron, Ben Simmons, those bigger play-making guards.  But I'm a Jalen Johnson fan now. Q. How do you see yourself fitting in with this roster and how do you think you can help this team? JALEN JOHNSON:   I'm going to help this team in whatever way I need to help them.  They came off a great season this past year, I'm just willing to do whatever it takes to add on to that.  The next goal is the Finals now, make it to the Finals.  I saw they got to the Eastern Conference Finals this past year, but I feel myself fitting in right away with this young, talented group and I'm looking forward to it. Q. Growing up in Wisconsin, when did you think that this dream was possible for you?  And what was it like just getting on the stage and shaking the Commissioner's hand? JALEN JOHNSON:   This is something I dreamed of my whole life.  It doesn't seem real, to be honest.  Being from Wisconsin you don't see a lot of guys, a lot of NBA talent.  Recently we have had a couple guys but prior to that, the dream just didn't seem as real.  But I'm blessed to be in this position. Q. Did you get to watch any of the Hawks during the playoffs?  And if so, what were your impressions of them? JALEN JOHNSON:   They're a crazy young talented group.  Like it's so fun to watch.  Trae, he was a bucket the whole playoffs and he was just entertainment, pure entertainment.  I'm excited to play with him, the other guys, Cam Reddish.  It's just a great young talented group.  I feel myself fitting in just great there.  So, they're definitely going to make some more noise in the next couple years. Q. Wondered what did you do to prepare for the NBA since February when you left Duke? JALEN JOHNSON:   I did everything. I worked on my shot a lot this past season or this past offseason.  Training with Chris Johnson, I credit a lot of my improvement to him.  He was consistent with me in the gym, two-a-days, three-a-days, and I improved a lot just overall, every aspect of my game, even the things I'm good at I sharpened up and continue to work on.  I'll never be satisfied.  So, at the end of the day I'm always going to work and continue to improve. Q. You said you talked to the Hawks at the NBA combine.  Do you remember how those conversations went and what they told you about how they see you fitting in? JALEN JOHNSON:   It's kind of tough to remember that because I interviewed with like 15, 16 teams.  But I do remember them just having, being genuine, yeah, but I don't really remember too much of the conversation.  I remember some of the things, but it wasn't nothing crazy. Q. This might be something that you probably didn't expect anyway, but did you have any idea that when you woke up today that you would be with the Hawks or did you have any inclination that Atlanta was interested in you? JALEN JOHNSON:   I didn't know and I kind of, quite frankly, I didn't want to know.  This day, I've been anxious just to find out wherever I was going to end up.  I had no clue who was going to pick me and I feel like, I felt I went to the Hawks for a reason. Atlanta picked me for a reason and I'm excited to just give them my all.  They showed belief in me by picking me, that's the least I can do is give them a hundred percent every day.\"}, 'Keon Johnson': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=168260', 'text': \"Q. Could you talk about your style of play? KEON JOHNSON:   I'm defensive-minded first.  Defense opens up my offensive game.  The more stops that I get on defense, the more that I fuel on the offensive end.  On the offensive end, I can play in the half court but also can handle the ball in the open court and facilitate for my teammates, as well. Q. Do you believe that your offense will bring a different type of composure to the Clippers, seeing that they were lacking more offensive output at the guard position? KEON JOHNSON:   I do believe that what I bring to the offensive end will be able to help the Clippers.  I also believe that throughout this whole process my game has completely grown and changed from whenever I was last seen at Tennessee. Q. The Clippers really pride themselves on defense.  That's something coach Ty Lue really stresses there.  One of the quick ways for young players to get playing time is playing defense.  How do you see that part of your game translating into the league, and is that something you feel you can make an impact right away on that end? KEON JOHNSON:   I feel that my defensive ability is what brought me to the league.  But I also believe that within the league I'll be able to guard multiple positions and fit in anywhere on the court with the Clippers. Q. The Clippers are coming off their first appearance in the Conference Finals.  This team is almost like a little key piece away from getting over the hump.  Do you believe that you are the answer, and how are you going to come into this team and kind of plug and chug alongside guys like Paul George and Kawhi Leonard, if he re-signs, and other guys? KEON JOHNSON:   I do believe I can come in and make an immediate impact as a younger player.  I'm open to learning from the vets.  Got some great vets in the organization, and I feel that with bringing me that I can potentially help the team get back to where it started.\"}, 'Isaiah Jackson': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=168263', 'text': \"Q. How does it feel to get your name called today? ISAIAH JACKSON:   I mean, it's a surreal moment.  Just growing up, just wanting, like having the dream of making it to the NBA, it's just crazy.  So, this is surreal moment for me and I'm enjoying it. Q. We talked when you were in Indy, what do you remember about that experience?  I know I think it was like your fourth workout at that point, you were trying to show that you could guard multiple positions and shoot, and clearly they liked what they saw. ISAIAH JACKSON:   I mean, I liked everything from the workout to, I mean, even Coach [Rick Carlisle] helping me out there to work out with my shot technique, to meeting with the front office, I loved everything about it in Indy and I can't wait to get there to get to work. Q. The Summer League is coming up in less than two weeks, how excited are you to play in the Summer League and what are some of your goals for the year? ISAIAH JACKSON:   I can't wait to start Summer League just to show everybody in the world what I've been working on this whole summer, what I been doing in workouts and stuff.  I want to just help Indiana win.  I know like last year they didn't have the best season but I can't wait to get there and just help them win.  That's my whole mentality, itâ€™s just going in and working and helping them win. Q. How did you feel Kentucky prepared you for this moment, for your professional career? ISAIAH JACKSON:   I feel like Kentucky helped me.  It taught me a lot of things.  One of them was like how to deal with adversity.  The other one was just on the court just playing tough, playing with that fire, playing like every game can be your last or the other team's championship.  So, just coming out with that fire and just playing tough. Q. What do you remember about that conversation with Rick?  You said you were working on your shot or something, is there something that stands out to you about that? ISAIAH JACKSON:   Just him doing it with me.  Like all the workouts I think he was the only coach that did that and I respected it.  He wanted to see me get better and I can't wait to get there and just keep working on it and just keep working period. Q. How did this experience the last week or two or last month really live up to maybe what you were hoping for or expecting? ISAIAH JACKSON:   It lived up to everything, just having my name called, getting drafted, it's just, it's mind blowing, like I'm still right now trying to -- I don't feel anything right now but I'm still trying to -- it just feels like a dream in a way, like it's just crazy right now, like I'm just trying to bottle all my emotions and it's just crazy, man. Q. What should Pacers fans know about Isaiah Jackson? ISAIAH JACKSON:   That I'm a hard worker, I bring it all, I'm a defensive anchor, I'm going to be their energy guy that Indiana needs and like I keep saying, I can't wait to get there and get to work and show everybody, prove everybody wrong. Q. You're going to be in the league this year, your rookie season, you have the opportunity to play against a lot of legendary forwards, same position as you. How is that going to feel to learn from them as well as take some of those things and implement that to your game? ISAIAH JACKSON:   I feel like just learning and playing against some of the best guys in the league is what the NBA is about.  Like it's learning, picking people's brains, just soaking everything in pretty much like a sponge.  So, that's what I'm planning to do, learn from all the vets that come into my life and everybody I play against, try to pick their brain.\"}, 'Jalen Green': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=168250', 'text': \"Q. What was something you took way from this whole process, just getting to the NBA from your whole life growing up and up to now? JALEN GREEN:   I think just the work ethic.  Finding a love for the game, working out and getting better every day.  There's going to be a lot of free time that you're going to have throughout the process, just got to get in the gym and work better and get better at your craft every day. Q. What have you seen from some of the young guys on the roster right now?  Obviously, the Rockets are trying to rebuild but they need a centerpiece going forward.  Do you think you can be that piece? JALEN GREEN:   Yeah, I think I can be that piece.  I think I can bring that dog mentality, that defensive mindset and an exciting part at the same time.  They already got a lot of star players, a lot of excitement on the team.  I think they're just missing one more piece and I think I can fulfill that. Q. What was it like when you heard your name? JALEN GREEN:   It was exciting.  After that I hugged my family and all the nervousness went away and we just walked on that stage.  All I was thinking about was the future, so it was an exciting moment for me. Q. What do you think about going to the Houston Rockets? JALEN GREEN:   I think it's awesome.  I'm excited.  I love their program, I love their coaches.  I'm just ready to go to work. Q. When we look back at this and all the discussion and everything that it took for the Rockets to have gotten to the second pick, what will people say three, four, five years from now about their choice to have chosen you? JALEN GREEN:   They're going to say it's a great choice because the goals that I have for myself, I plan on reaching them.  So, if everything goes right, they're going to say that. Q. What are those? JALEN GREEN:   Great choice.  Rookie of the Year, All-Star, All-Defense, max contract, weâ€™re doing it big, so, yeah. Q. As you look back at this entire process from the time you declared yourself to go to the G League until now, could this have been any more of a dream scenario for you to walk across that stage, put the hat on for the Houston Rockets, could it have been any better in this moment right now for you? JALEN GREEN:   No, I enjoy every part of it from the G League to now.  I learned so much, I think I grew up so much, I learned about myself, got a lot of knowledge on and off the court.  No, it couldn't have gone any better.  I got my family here with me and that's the most important thing for me, that's the main thing that's making me happy right now, my family here to support me. Q. You say you learned a lot from the G League and your coaches, what is some of the things that you learned from your coaches about playing in the NBA and what you're going see in the future? JALEN GREEN:   Just terminologies, how to get through the highs and lows, watching film, breaking down film, foot work, a whole bunch of things.  I could keep going on with a list of how much we learned, but not even just on the court, like off the court too, lifestyle things.  So, it all worked out perfectly. Q. Can we talk about the suit for a second?  What's the inspiration behind the suit and what role will fashion play in you building this character that is Jalen in the NBA? JALEN GREEN:   The inspiration behind it was I wanted to come different.  I originally had a black suit.  This was a backup suit and ended up working out perfect because we didn't want to come to the draft and make a statement with the suit.  But going into the NBA I think I've already made a statement about how drip and how I dress and how I carry myself and I continue to -- I'm going to continue to do that through the NBA. Q. I know you spent some time in Houston already and around the team.  What has been your takeaway up until now? JALEN GREEN:   I think just the coaching staff and the offense and how theyâ€™re trying to focus in on defense.  I think it just matched all my goals and it played to my strengths.  It's a lot of pick-and-rolls, a lot of back door cuts and I'm trying to be All-Team defense, so it's all going to work out perfectly. Q. There was a tweet about the three Filipinos in the NBA and so you're going to Houston which has a large Asian population, large Filipino community, and the last time they had a draft pick this high was actually Yao Ming.  So, what does it mean to you, how excited are you to meet everyone out there and represent? JALEN GREEN:   Man, I'm always excited to represent the Philippines.  So, the fact that there's ties in Houston it's kind of like it was scripted.  So, I'm excited to take that out there and just represent and put on for the Philippines and can't wait to meet everybody and see the fans.  It's going to be exciting. Q. How excited are you to face off with Jordan Clarkson for the first time?  He's the only other Filipino in the league. JALEN GREEN:   I'm excited, I can't wait, I cannot wait, I can't wait, I'll tell you that much. Q. To piggyback maybe some of the other questions about the Philippines, itâ€™s clear now that the Houston Rockets are going to get a major fan base from this side of the world, given your roots.  I just want to ask, like how are you approaching taking that responsibility of knowing that there's an entire country and an entire nation rooting for you to succeed and hoping you shine as a superstar? JALEN GREEN:   From what I got that the Philippines love me for me.  So, I'm just going to keep being myself I'm going to keep working hard and staying in the gym.  It's not really a responsibility, it's the game I love and they support me, so I just can't wait to get out there and just put on for them.  I'm excited.\"}, 'Josh Giddey': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=168246', 'text': \"Q. Wanted to get your thoughts on being drafted by the Thunder and just sort of the explain to us what your conversations were like in the pre-draft process. JOSH GIDDEY:   Yeah, look first it's a dream come true so to be taken by the Thunder and to have them want me on their team it makes me feel really special and I couldn't be happier. The pre-draft process was good.  Oklahoma is actually one of my favorite teams and to be picked by them it's a dream come true.  So, love the guys, the coaches, the staff on the team and really happy to be there. Q. You were the NBL Rookie of the Year last year and you also had a chance to follow behind another NBL Rookie of the Year, LaMelo Ball that plays for the Hornets.  Watching him become a top-5 pick last year, did that motivate you, knowing that the NBA's paying attention to players in Australia, players like yourself, knowing that you can be in the same shoes that you're in right now? JOSH GIDDEY:   Yeah, it does.  I did, sorry.  And watching LaMelo and R.J. Hampton go through that same process and see how well their game translated from the NBL to the NBA gave me confidence going in that hopefully I can do something a little bit similar.  Lucky enough I did, I landed in a good spot and having LaMelo and R.J. with the attention they brought from America to Australia was big, and I was just lucky enough that the limelight was still on me at the time, and, yeah, like I said, it's just, they had so much attention on the league and it allowed me to go in there with lots of eyes on it so it was a good time for me to enter the league. Q. How does it feel to be continuing the Australian NBA legacy? Obviously, you're from Melbourne there's been a bunch of draft picks from Melbourne in the modern NBA era, how does it feel to be continuing that Australian legacy? JOSH GIDDEY:   Like it's really special.  To follow on from the guys we have had go through the NBA, it means a lot to me and I looked up to those guys for a long time and I speak to them and try and get advice from them.  And I was watching them on TV, I'm big fans of theirs.  And even two years ago I was watching their highlights and trying to get them to reply to my Instagram messages and all that stuff.  So, following in their footsteps being drafted in the NBA, it's really special. The Australian basketball community is really tight.  So, to have those guys by my side and supporting me through this whole process has been really good for me. Q. You've obviously spoken a fair bit about how big this moment is.  Just when you think back about the last season with Adelaide and even spending time with the Boomers camp in Vegas, just how much has that process helped you?  I guess a couple of weeks ago how much has that whole process helped you if you go back 12 months ago, this time 12 months ago, and from Adelaide to the Boomers and being so close to the Olympic team as well, how much has this journey, has all that helped you to get to that point today? JOSH GIDDEY:   Yeah, lots.  The Boomers was really good for me, regardless of making the team or not, just to be in that environment, be around the veterans we have and the talent we have, it's not just the on-court aspect of getting to compete against them and stuff like that it's also off court, getting to learn from them, talk to them, get advice from them, and it was good.  We had guys that were veterans in the league and we had guys that were rookies in the league. So, it was good to hear it from two perspectives and they were all really supportive of me leading up to this process, and it was great to be around them.  I mean, as I said, I mentioned the off court but obviously on the court you get to go against them every day.  The Boomers culture is such a strong one and hopefully going forward for the next 15, 20 years, it's something I can be a part of. Q. With the Summer League coming up in just less than two weeks are you looking forward to doing that and will you play in the Summer League? JOSH GIDDEY:   Absolutely.  I can't wait.  Just to get on the court again start playing I can't wait for it.  For it to be with the Thunder is, it's a bonus as well.  So, yeah, I'll be at Summer League and I can't wait for it. Q. What was it like to share this with your family?  We know your mom and dad both have legacies in the NBL and WNBL, what's it like to share it with them?  What's it like to take the Giddey name to the NBA after your upbringing? JOSH GIDDEY:   It means the world.  To have my family, it was tough to get them over here from Australia and to have them on the table tonight to be able to hug them in that moment and be with them tonight, it means a lot for me, and for them to enjoy this moment with me as well because I give a lot of credit to them, they have raised me the right way, they have spent countless hours getting me -- sacrificing their time for me and my basketball.  So, they deserve this moment just as much as I do and I'm really happy that they're here with me and I got to share it with them. Q. Will you be near your sister now, is she not too far away in college at Oral Roberts? JOSH GIDDEY:   She actually is.  She's in Tulsa which is about an hour and a half out of Oklahoma, so this was a dream situation and my parents are over the moon about it now because they can visit both me and her. Q. So quick question, how important has the NBA academy in Canberra been for your development and how crucial has it been to getting you to where you are now? JOSH GIDDEY:   Big time.  I mean I don't know if you guys can see but I actually have a badge on me tonight to kind of represent them and everything they did for me.  And when I went to the Academy, I was definitely not an NBA prospect, I was a good player but I was never where I am now.  Credit to them, they developed me, trained me, pushed me to be a better player and they got the most out of me for the 18 months I was there.  So, to Marty Clarke, Adam Caporn, Robbie McKinley, Chris Ebersole there's countless people I want to thank.  That they did an awesome job with me and allowed me to grow and developing my basketball. Q. You mentioned early on that Oklahoma City, the Thunder was a team that was a favorite of yours? What was it that put them up towards the top in your mind of a team that you were interested in? JOSH GIDDEY:   They were just great people.  I mean, they were straight up from day one.  I met with -- I was talking to Sam [Presti] and the rest of the staff and coaches and stuff like that and just the way they talked and told me about how they want to lift their program and the direction they're headed in, it was something I wanted to be a part of.  It's a young team and I think it can be something really special and I wanted to be a part of that. Moving forward hopefully in the next coming years that we can have a lot of success in Oklahoma, and as I keep saying, but it was really something I wanted to be a part of and kind of start from the bottom and move our way up in the league.  It's a great young team and I can't wait to get down there and get started.\"}, 'Chris Duarte': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=168258', 'text': \"Q. Being from the Dominican Republic, not many NBA players you see come from out of there.  How does it feel to be able to go out there and represent your country? CHRIS DUARTE:   It feels amazing.  A kid from the Dominican Republic, like you said, not a lot of kids make it out.  So me being one of those kids, it's a blessing.  I'm grateful for my family and the people that helped me to get here.  I'm grateful for the work I put in.  It feels amazing, man.  I'm really excited about the future. Q. I know you probably have a dream matchup that you want to face in the NBA.  Is there a particular player that you're looking forward to matching up with? CHRIS DUARTE:   I'm just going to go to the NBA and try to win games, try to help my team win.  Whatever it takes to win games and help my team, I'm willing to do it.  If I have to defend the best player on the other team, I will do it. Q. They didn't bring you in until late in the process, I guess, to pre-draft workout.  Did you have any sense that they were looking at you in this way?  Do you know the reason that you were drafted?  It seems they wanted somebody who was not a developmental guy but a guy who was ready to play and contribute now.  Is that the sense you got from them and the feedback and why you're here today? CHRIS DUARTE:   My workouts were great, so I knew I was going to go from 9 to 15.  I went to Indiana and I had a great, great workout over there.  I met with the people, with the front office, and we really connected well.  I talked to the coach and I talked to everybody over there, and it was really, really good.  We went out to eat.  It was a great experience.  I really enjoyed my time over there. When I left Indiana, I left confident in myself.  So I knew if I was on the board by Indiana coming to pick, I knew that there was a high chance that they were going to take me. Q. To encapsulate your journey, to go from Puerto Plata and the path you took in Philly and rural Massachusetts and being hungry on the bus, the sixth man in junior college, to now being a lottery pick in the NBA and the first of Coach Altman's tenure at Oregon, what do you say to you mom, what do you say to your girl and your son tonight about what this journey was and what the last 10 years of your life that got you here? CHRIS DUARTE:   Well, I'm going to say this in Spanish so my mom can understand. Mi mama, la amo bastante.  Ella que me siempre apoyaba, la buena y la mala.  Mi papa que me criÃ³, y mi familia que nos mantenemos siempre juntos, que siempre que me ha soportado, me ha apoyado mi mujer, mi hijo, cada una de esa persona que me ayudaba. I'm just grateful for those people that helped me, that helped me to get here, my coaches, every coach I played for.  Steve DeMeo. Going to Oregon, Dana Altman.  And other coaches that helped me.  I'm just grateful for those people. I'm just really excited and happy. Q. Have you heard anything about Rick Carlisle as a head coach?  And what are you looking forward to with Rick Carlisle being your head coach for the Pacers? CHRIS DUARTE:   Well, he's a great coach.  I spoke to him when I went there.  He's a great coach, and I know he's going to get the best out of me. Q. I'm curious, they described you as kind of a 3-and-D guy.  I'm curious about being able to guard kind of wings and bigger guys at the NBA level.  How prepared do you feel like you are for that and how much are you looking forward to that challenge? CHRIS DUARTE:   Like I say, I'm ready to play.  I'm ready to play.  When I say I'm ready to play, that means offensively, defensively, on and off the court.  That's all I can say.  I'm ready to guard through one three.  I'm trying to get ready to guard one through four if that's possible.  So looking forward to it. Q. I'm curious, when you were here we asked you about your transition and how you didn't know the language and all that, and obviously you've become a father.  How has all the challenges that you have faced up to this point helped shape you to now where you can enjoy this moment? CHRIS DUARTE:   You know what, all that helped me to get here.  What I went through coming from the D.R., going through high school in Boston, Massachusetts, and going to juco and then going to Oregon and now here, having a kid my first year in Oregon, everything helped me to get here because now I think different.  Having a kid made me think different.  Now before I do something, I think about him.  Now it's not me anymore; it's him, my girl and me.  Everything just helped me to get here mentally. Q. How hard was it to find a suit to match your kid's?  It couldn't have been easy with his size. CHRIS DUARTE:   He got a 12-month size.  That was not hard to find, the suit.  And then mine is customized.  So thank God that that was easy to do that.\"}, 'Cade Cunningham': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=168245', 'text': \"Q. Just start by talking about what you'll bring to the Pistons. CADE CUNNINGHAM:   What's going on, everybody?  I'm so excited just to have this hat on right now.  Still pretty surreal to me.  But I know how much responsibility comes with being the No. 1 pick.  I know how much responsibility a city will put on the guy that they take No. 1.  But I'm more than excited to take on those tasks and try to deliver to the city of Detroit. I'm just happy to be here, thankful for the opportunity and ready to get started. Q. Obviously you came here tonight knowing you'd be the top pick.  Can you explain what it's like to hear your name called No. 1 overall by the Commissioner and I'm sure a lifelong dream? CADE CUNNINGHAM:   Yeah, it's crazy because I've been trying to wrap my head around it for a while, just the fact of getting drafted.  But like you said, once you hear that name, it's like all the plans that you made beforehand, all that is out the window.  All those emotions hit you again. It was surreal for me.  I'm glad I had my family all there for it.  I've got all my family up in the stands.  To be able to experience that with all of them, I'm happy. Q. Just with the young core that the Pistons have built, last year especially in the draft, what do you think you bring to that mix, and what's your expectation for this year? CADE CUNNINGHAM:   Last year Detroit had a great draft I feel like.  Getting two All-Rookie (players) is huge.  It's a great young core that they already have, along with Killian Hayes, who coming off of injury, he's going to have a big year this year. I'm excited to be able to join that young core and grow together with them.  I think that's the biggest thing.  I want to hop right in and contribute to the mentality that they go into games with.  They want to defend, they want to play hard and that's what I want to come in and provide for them, as well.  I don't want to take a step back from the mentality that the team has.  Detroit Pistons has always been about grit and working for everything that they have. You look back on the Bad Boys teams, that's what made those teams great.  I want to try to bring that mentality to the team.  I know that they already have young guys that have that mentality, and I feel like me just adding on will only take us to the next step. Q. I'm going to throw you a little bit of a curveball. CADE CUNNINGHAM:   Let's see. Q. Somewhere down the road, a year, two years, 10 years this is going to be remembered that Russell Westbrook got traded to the Lakers or the night Cade Cunningham got drafted by the Pistons.  Which is it going to be and why? CADE CUNNINGHAM:   I think it will be Cade Cunningham's night, that he got drafted by the Pistons, because when people look back, that will be the start of whenever the Pistons restored their franchise and brought greatness back to the city.  That's my whole goal stepping into Detroit, to restore that city. They've already had championship teams. They've already witnessed greatness.  I want to be able to bring that back to the city. Q. What's the most important thing your father and your older brother taught you that you will take into the league with you? CADE CUNNINGHAM:   My pops, I mean, he is the hardest worker I've ever met in my life.  He's wired to work -- to wake up at 3:45 every morning, no matter if it's a holiday, no matter what's going on, he's ready to get up and work.  That's a fact.  I've never seen him oversleep.  I've never seen him complain about working.  So to have that as the head of your household, I mean, you can only take from that and learn from it and apply it to your life. I know how much hard work can bring you, and to be in this position now is a testament to that. My brother has pushed me crazy, just like my pops.  He wants greatness out of me.  He's pushed me to be great since I was a kid.  He's never taken it easy on me.  He's always kept it real with me.  That's why those two guys are the biggest influences in my life, because they've always kept it real with me and they've always been there to support me. Q. Arlington Texas, Bowie High School.  Can you talk about what it means to come out of Arlington, and who are you most excited to face in the NBA? CADE CUNNINGHAM:   I mean, coming out of Arlington, I'm very prideful about my city.  I love my city to the end of me.  I'm born and raised there.  I've learned so much there.  All my friends grew up there.  I've had ups, downs, everything in Arlington, Texas.  That's a place I'll always call home and will always be grateful for. You know, in the NBA I want to carry that same Arlington swag and step in with the same mentality that somebody from the DFW has. I feel like stepping onto the court with the greats that I've watched for a long time, the LeBrons, Giannis -- I mean, Giannis is great right now, but the LeBrons, the Kawhis, the guys that have been in the league for a while that have been killing, I'm excited to be able to step on the court and see them in person and learn from them and take as much as I can from them. And then the Giannises and the young guys, Lukas, Ja Morants, all those guys in the league right now giving the NBA a spark and the young core, I'm excited to try to add onto that and be the next guy that's coming in and making a real impact. Q. What's your quintessential Detroit Pistons memory from growing up in Austin and in Oklahoma? CADE CUNNINGHAM:   Well, my brother played for Larry Brown at SMU.  I've heard plenty of stories about the Bad Boys teams and things like that.  I was young for those teams.  But I've talked to LB.  I've heard stories from my brother about those teams and things like that. So yeah, I was already kind of hip to what they had going on.  But I'll just say being able to finally meet Larry Brown, somebody that won an NBA championship for the organization and to be in his presence for three years for my brother's college career, the last three years, to be in his presence and learn as much as I learned from him was a blessing. Q. You see that this is obviously a very young team.  They had a lot of rookies last year and some other young guys and you kind of fit right in with that.  Does that kind of add to the energy knowing that you're stepping into a situation where you have a lot of guys your age obviously with the same goal and in the same situation as you? CADE CUNNINGHAM:   Yeah, it definitely adds a lot of energy to it.  But I think more than anything it makes everybody know that we're going to have to work a lot harder, being young guys in the NBA.  No vet is going to want to lose to a young team like Detroit Pistons. I know me, I know the team, I know we're ready for that challenge.  I know we're ready to step into any game and show people that we're really trying to restore the Pistons and bring that greatness back to Detroit. Q. What were your impressions of Dwane Casey and Troy Weaver when you first met them?  You mentioned restore.  That's something Troy tells us all the time.  What did you take away from those talks? CADE CUNNINGHAM:   More than anything, they're locked in and they're stuck on restoring them.  I heard that so many times throughout my visit in Detroit, and it stuck with me just because it makes sense. Seeing the two guys that are leading that organization as far as the head coach and general manager having that type of motivation to bring the team back, I mean, I know it's their job.  I know that technically they're supposed to feel that way.  But to really feel the genuine feel that I had from them, it meant a lot to me and it gave me a different confidence going in because I know I'm going to be in a good situation. Q. You mentioned playing with Killian Hayes.  How do you think Dwane Casey will use both of you in facilitation roles? CADE CUNNINGHAM:   I think me stepping in will help Killian a lot and I think Killian will help me a whole lot.  I feel like we'll take a lot of pressure off each other. Both of us are capable of being primary ball handlers and both of us are capable of playing off the ball and making things happen off the ball. I feel like it will be a good mix.  I feel like it will bring a lot of versatility to our backcourt.  We're both big, we're both strong and we're both playing under control.  I feel like it will be a different look from a backcourt, and I think we'll be successful.\"}, 'James Bouknight': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=168251', 'text': \"Q. How excited are you to play with LaMelo Ball in Charlotte? JAMES BOUKNIGHT:   I'm super excited.  I think we're both young players that play with a lot of flare, have a lot of swag in our game and it's going to be exciting to watch. Q. What were your emotions like during the course of the evening?  Was it a roller coaster for you or did you kind of anticipate where you were going to be picked, what were the emotions like for you as things played out? JAMES BOUKNIGHT:   I say it was up and down.  I felt like I started to slip a little bit, but I feel like I kept my composure.  I know that on draft night anything can happen, and I was just waiting for my name to be called and when it was called all the sadness I guess you could say went away and it was just a big joy. Q. Charlotte is one of the more exciting teams in the league with LaMelo Ball running the wings, and one of the things Mitch Kupchak had mentioned is the fact that he said that they didn't expect you to be on the board at 11.  They had you ranked much higher.  What are some of the things that Hornets fans should expect from you and is that a compliment when a general manager says we didn't think we were going to get you at 11, we thought you were going to go much higher? JAMES BOUKNIGHT:   Oh, yeah, man, so Charlotte was my first workout.  I went into that workout and I was ready.  It was definitely easily my best workout.  I think it for sure is a compliment that he thought I wasnâ€™t going to fall, but since I was here and he picked me, that's big time and I'm excited to be here. Q. You mentioned about being sad about dropping in the draft, but is that an extra chip on your shoulder and something to prove inside the NBA? JAMES BOUKNIGHT:   Oh, a hundred percent.  The whole time, every pick, pick after pick I was just sitting there in my head like, okay, I got a chip on my shoulder again, they sleep, you know what I'm saying?  So, it's nothing different.  My whole life I've been slept on and Charlotte took the chance and I'm not going to let them down. Q. You're heading into Charlotte with a team full of a lot of young, electric talent.  You've got Miles Bridges, LaMelo Ball.  How do you look to add your talent to this team for your rookie season and what are your expectations for the first year? JAMES BOUKNIGHT:   Oh, man, I have high expectations for myself.  I never try to sell myself short.  I think we're going to be one of the better young teams in the league.  We're going to be a team that's fun to watch, super athletic on the wings.  Like I said before, just playing with a lot of flare, a lot of excitement.  We're going to be box office. Q. Was it tough -- obviously Coach [Danny] Hurley and Coach Kimani [Young] couldn't be here today.  Was that tough, and what did they kind of say to you early in the day maybe or what kind of advice did they give you or support did they give you earlier today? JAMES BOUKNIGHT:   Oh, yeah, it was definitely tough.  I found out what happened at the same time everybody else found out what happened, and I was actually talking to Kimani on the phone in the Green Room.  He was just -- they were just telling me how proud they are of me, nothing less, nothing more.  Just how proud they are and to keep making UConn proud. Q. I was wondering what your day was like being obviously back home in Brooklyn and what this night being in Brooklyn, did that add anything to you, make it more special at all? JAMES BOUKNIGHT:   Oh, yeah, this is definitely a legendary moment.  Like I said it before, I'm going to keep on saying it, not many people can say that they're from Brooklyn and they got drafted in Brooklyn, in the Lottery at that.  So, this moment for me is definitely a legendary one.\"}, 'Scottie Barnes': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=168249', 'text': \"Q. I know today is the first day of your NBA career, but what legacy do you want to leave behind when your career is all said and done? SCOTTIE BARNES:   I just want to be great.  I'm just a great person, I'm a great teammate, I'm a great player, I want to be known for someone that just puts in the time, puts in the work, someone that's great, that just does it all.  Striving for greatness I'm going to keep working, staying in the gym, I just want to leave that legacy that I'm that guy that I can really be -- I'm a great person and a great teammate as well, I will say. Q. During the pre-draft process did it feel like, did you get a sense that the Raptors were kind of really narrowing in on you?  And also what kind of fit do you think you have with the team? SCOTTIE BARNES:   Really, I didn't really know what team really wanted me.  I didn't know.  I just didn't have any expectations.  I just really just came into to each workout not knowing, just trying to be the best person I can be, just trying to be myself, really.  I wasn't trying to overdo things. I was just being myself.  When I got there no matter if it's on the court and I just showed my personality. Q. How do you think you would fit with this kind of like young Raptors backcourt? SCOTTIE BARNES:   I would say I fit in perfect.  Just with what their whole game plan is based off, they start off with a defensive mindset, a defensive mentality, I feel like I belong in that program.  So, I would just say I can fit right in doing different things to help other people, other people can help me, I feel like I fit right in. Q. I have to ask you about your time in high school, obviously that was part of your formative years.  What was your biggest takeaway that you took from there.  And also your time at FSU, just all the steps that led to this moment, what is your biggest takeaway from your high school career and college career now going into the NBA? SCOTTIE BARNES:   I would say my biggest takeaway from my high school career, remain humble, remain humble, stay solid, keep working, keep just trying to get better.  My high school I would just say it was just me just working, trying to have that mindset.  I would say that mindset just started each and every practice where it was just like I was just trying to lock in to everything. I would say college, my biggest takeaway from college was just staying mature, growing up, being who I am on the floor, working on different aspects of the game.  It was more of, I was learning more mental components of what it takes to be a pro at Florida State.  Florida State, they develop a lot of pros, the program is just rising and rising.  So, I would just say developing that pro mentality, that pro mindset. Q. You're a player that is claimed to have very high potential in this draft and one of the big things is unlocking your shooting potential.  So, what are you going to do to make sure that your shooting potential unlocks your game, that you can become that kind of all-time talent, player that can lead the Raptors to greatness? SCOTTIE BARNES:   Of course I feel like my shooting improved so much tremendously since the college season but of course it's getting with the program, being able to, willing to work with them, trying to, if they feel like they need to fix something in it, I'm willing to work with them to try to fix whatever it needs.  I'm willing to do whatever it takes to try to be the best player I can be, being that great, being at the top of the league, being able to just come in day and day out knowing that I'm the best player on the floor.  I'm trying to achieve greatness. So, I'm going to be -- I'm able, I'm open to working with them, trying to fix different things with my jump shot but I also feel like I improved tremendously with my jump shot to where it's at now. Q. Wanted to know when or how what indication you got that you might be drafted by Toronto tonight or were you surprised a little bit as well as some others were or did you have a good feeling coming into today? SCOTTIE BARNES:   I didn't really know where, but I really, I really didn't just expect anything.  I just came in and like I said, I just came in with the I don't know mindset, I don't know what was going to happen, I just came in just trying to live by the moment until when I got my name called.  It was just a huge bit of excitement that I felt for me and my family. Q. What are your ambitions as a NBA player? SCOTTIE BARNES:   I would say my ambitions, probably, I can say, I say I can be one -- I can be if not the top player in the league or one of those top players in the league with my mindset because I'm just willing to work, I'm willing to get better, I know I'm a great defensive player but I also have the offensive tools which is pretty slept on, I would say, with the abilities that I can do on the floor.  I know I can really create for myself, I really can score the ball, I will say I envision myself, if not being the best player in the league but one of the best players as well. Q. We spoke a couple times during the season where you were at FSU during the ACC tournament and NCAA tournament and you mentioned how being in the system at Florida State allowed the rest of the country to see the other parts of your game, other than you just being a scorer.  You did the same thing in high school.  What is the things that you have worked on the most since the last time we saw you play a college game at Florida State until this moment right now, what have you worked on the most and how can people -- what player do you see yourself as or people can kind of recognize you towards in the league now? SCOTTIE BARNES:   I probably -- I don't know about the last question about just people just seeing me play, trying to compare me to someone, but I would just say Iâ€™ve just been working on is just constantly day in and day out my jump shot, no matter if it's on the ball, off the dribble, just getting tons and tons of reps day in, day out.  Constantly developing, working on my finishing moves against the basket, I'm just working on a lot of areas of my game, I'm just still trying to get better, even the aspects where I'm already good at I'm still trying to get better. Q. We had a chance to talk to [Raptors GM] Bobby Webster yesterday and he mentioned how like they had a room and they're interviewing prospects to get the Toronto experience.  Like a Toronto experience room, did you see that yourself and can you tell us a little bit about what that's like? SCOTTIE BARNES:   I actually did, when I went on my, when I went to my pre-draft workout with the Raptors, I actually did.  It just shows me different things about the city, it's a really nice city.  It's beautiful.  So, I would just say I really like the city, I really want to go see it for myself in person. Q. Have you ever been to Canada before? SCOTTIE BARNES:   No, I had never been there before, but I know I have family out there, a lot of my Jamaican family is out there on my dad's side, so I know there's a lot of people that's like Jamaican out there and so I have family out there as well.\"}}, 2022: {'Mark Williams': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=177715', 'text': \"Q. Charlotte has a big hole at center.  Now that you're coming in, what are you going to give them? MARK WILLIAMS:   Yeah, on the offensive end, an athletic big guy, someone that is catching lobs and finishing everything around the rim, running the floor. And then obviously on the defensive end, providing that rim protection.  Blocking shots, altering shots, protecting the paint and doing all those things. Just doing whatever it takes to win. Q. How excited are you to play alongside LaMelo Ball? MARK WILLIAMS:   Really excited.  Obviously, he's a great point guard.  He can make plays and can score and can do a little bit of everything.  So I'm really excited for that. Q. So not only do you get to play with LaMelo, but you're joining a team that could really use defense.  How excited are you to know they will be looking at you to be one of the one key players to turn their fortunes around on that side of the ball? MARK WILLIAMS:   For sure.

But I think we have the same type of play style, so I think it'll be cool to compete against him in practice every day. Q. What was your reaction to getting drafted by the Thunder?  I know you've talked about it before, but what was your communication with them in the pre-draft process? JALEN WILLIAMS:   I mean, first, try not to ugly cry when you hear your name get called.  It's kind of a surreal moment and it's hard to really put into words. I worked out with them probably a couple weeks ago now.  I had a really good workout and the vibes were really good and it was a really competitive environment going forward. So I really enjoyed working out there. Q. You're going to Oklahoma.  Chet is there and Shai is there.  What are you looking to bring to that team? JALEN WILLIAMS:   I think just defensive fire.  I think everybody can score the ball.  I think just being able to be versatile on defense, as well, and bring that competitive spirit into that gym. Q. I know you've played against Chet before.  Are you looking forward to being teammates with him in Oklahoma City? JALEN WILLIAMS:   Oh, absolutely.  I think it's a dope experience.  He's super talented.

They have drafted a few other players in the first round tonight.  What do you think of the other guys and the city and team in general? TYTY WASHINGTON JR:   The two other guys they have taken, we played in the same conference in college.  So I'm familiar with their games.  Me and Jabari played a little bit in high school together in a camp, so I know how he plays as well.  I feel like us three are going to jell really good together. I know a few guys that are already on the team as of right now.  So I feel like I can just go in there and connect with the guys on and off the court and it's going to be an easy transition.

It'll be special, for sure. Q. How excited are you to play alongside guys like D'Aaron Fox, Domantas Sabonis, and Harrison Barnes? KEEGAN MURRAY:   Yeah, I think playing alongside them, they all have experience and they've all been there.  I think for me it's about learning from them and kind of being that guy that is always on their shoulder, always learning, things like that, to adjust to the league. I feel like it'll be really good for me and my career to be going into that scene, and I'm excited to get to work, for sure. Q. With all the fuss about Jaden Ivey and now you're the fourth pick that Sacramento made, do you feel you have a chip on your shoulder to prove that they made the right choice? KEEGAN MURRAY:   Yeah, I always have a chip on my shoulder.  I mean, three years ago I was an unranked recruit going to Iowa, and I'll never forget that feeling. For me, I'll have that chip on my shoulder no matter what.  I know that greatness takes time and I know that I have a long ways to go in my development as a basketball player, so for me it's being able to be the best version of myself and get down there and see what happens.  I really think it'll be good. Q. You're now the highest drafted player in the history of the University of Iowa basketball program.  What does that mean to you? KEEGAN MURRAY:   It's a great feeling.  Especially to do that in two years.  It's special.  I've grown up next to University of Iowa, live 25 minutes away from it growing up.  To have that under my belt I feel like is really special because a lot of great players have came through. For me, I wear it with pride.  It's just it builds for future generations, for the Iowa basketball program, and it shows that you can come here and be special.  It's not the most glamorous place in the world, but we get the job done. For me, it's a really great feeling.\"}, 'Bryce McGowens': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=177728', 'text': \"Q. What has this day been like for and you how does it feel like to have your dream come true? BRYCE McGOWENS:   This day has been amazing, getting a chance to be here, celebrate this with my family.  This was my dream since I can remember.  So just being able to be here and get drafted, it means everything to me.  I thank God. Q. You're going to a Minnesota team that just made the playoffs and you're going to team up with stars like Anthony Edwards, Karl-Anthony Towns.  How excited are you to play with those guys and is there anybody else you're really looking forward to get to go work with? BRYCE McGOWENS:   Yes, that's a great group of guys in Minnesota.  So having the opportunity to go against them every day, learn and just compete against them is going to be major for me. Q. What's the No. 1 thing that you're going to be able to bring to the team right away to help them win? BRYCE McGOWENS:   Just a scoring spark, me being able to score at all three levels.  Bringing in early leadership and just a competitive spirit. Q. Are you going to use the fact that you fell to the second rounds as a source of inspiration?  A lot of guys often do.  Is that something you're going to do? BRYCE McGOWENS:   Most definitely.\"}, 'Bennedict Mathurin': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=177713', 'text': \"Q.

My goal is to have an impact already on both ends of the floor and bring W's to the team. Q. What are you going to buy with your first official NBA paycheck, and who are you looking forward to playing against? BENNEDICT MATHURIN:   To be honest, I'm not going to spend my money.  I think most of it, I'm just going to save it.  I'm looking forward to playing against Luguentz Dort a lot.  We're from the same neighborhood, so he's the one. Q. You're going to a team with Haliburton, one of the best playmakers in the game, and obviously you yourself have a great ability to score the ball.  How excited are you to get that chemistry together working offensively? BENNEDICT MATHURIN:   I feel like I'm pretty excited, to be honest.  Tomorrow I'm going to wake up and be a Pacer.  Just having the chance to play with Tyrese, Chris (Duarte) and the other guys on the team is going to be fun. Like you said, Tyrese likes to pass the ball.  He can really pass the ball.  He's a great teammate, as well. I'm really looking forward to playing with them and just having fun playing the game. Q. Can you talk a little bit about how the NBA Academy prepared you for the NBA level? BENNEDICT MATHURIN:   I would say the NBA Academy helped me a lot. Just getting used to the NBA lifestyle basically, just living by myself.  I come from Montreal.  For the team, lived in MÃ©xico for two years.  Learned a new language, new culture, started eating tacos and stuff. I feel like it really prepared me.  Just living by myself and being a grown-up at a young age, basically. Q. What guys are you excited to match up against, and who did you model your game after? BENNEDICT MATHURIN:   One guy I'm really excited to play against is Luguentz Dort.  We're from the same neighborhood.  I used to see him, call him my big bro.  Now we're at the next level, so it's about time for me to show him who's really the big bro.  Looking forward to playing against him. Some players I like to model my game after are Jimmy Butler, Jaylen Brown.  I feel like they're two really good comparisons for me, but also they're just two-way players and they're like dogs inside of them. I mean, it's great.  Those two players are really some players I put myself to.\"}, 'Walker Kessler': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=177717', 'text': \"Q. Your overall thoughts getting selected and thoughts about Memphis? WALKER KESSLER:   You know, I'm ecstatic.  I'm excited for the opportunity.

I'm just so excited. Q. I assume you're looking forward to playing with Ja Morant? WALKER KESSLER:   Yeah, super, super looking forward to it.  Super excited about, just playing in the league in general.  Just super excited. Q. What do you think you can provide to the Grizzlies day one?

ISMAEL KAMAGATE:   More exciting, more motivation to be better day after day.  Yeah, you get many players who get drafted late and make a good career.  I'm not worried about this. Q. Are you going to use the fact that you fell to the second round as inspiration to improve yourself? ISMAEL KAMAGATE:   For sure.  For sure. Q. You have the ability to score inside and the ability to block shots.  What other skills are you going to look to add and home in on as you go to the professional level? ISMAEL KAMAGATE:   I think I'm going to have to work to improve my shot, my passing game, my running, too.  I think I have to improve on my post play, too, offensive play, because I'm more a defensive player. Sometimes I'm thinking too much what I'm going to do on offense.  Even if I have a good read, I have to make a quicker decision. Q. Are there any players in who you model your game after? ISMAEL KAMAGATE:   I really look at Bam Adebayo's game because he can do everything on the court.

You're going to a team that is really well known for how well they develop young players, so how excited are you to go to a team with that track record? NIKOLA JOVIC:   I think it's a perfect fit for me, especially because they are a team who are contenders to win the title. I'm a competitive guy, so I always try to win.  I think it's a perfect fit for me right now. Q. Did you watch Game 7 of the Eastern Conference Finals, and if you did, did you find yourself thinking, if I could make one play or two plays that would have been the difference in that game to help the team move on? NIKOLA JOVIC:   There were a lot of plays in that game.  I watched that game.  I was actually at the arena for, what was that game, I'm not sure, Game 5 at Miami. But Game 7, you know, they were just unlucky.  That's all I'm going to say.  Things didn't work out how they thought they would.  That's all. Of course, when you look at the game again, you always make a mistake.  So they know already what mistakes they made and for sure they're working on it. Q. Like you said, they are a contender and they have a lot of high-level vets like Jimmy Butler and Kyle Lowry.  How excited are you to learn with guys who have been in the league and excelled at such a high level? NIKOLA JOVIC:   I think it's perfect because you can learn a lot from those guys, always, 24/7.  I'm sure I'm going to learn a lot.  I'm always trying to get more and more experience every day.  With them, I'm sure I'm going to learn something new. Q. What's the first thing you're going to buy with an NBA paycheck, and who do you look forward to play against? NIKOLA JOVIC:   First thing I'm going to buy, I'm not sure.  Something for my family, for sure.  I just want to get a gift for all of them because they are always here for me. Who I'm looking forward to play against?  Everyone.  I want to compete.  That's all. Q. Do you anticipate it being a bit of a challenge to adjust to the U.S., and Miami in specific, and what do you think of the city? NIKOLA JOVIC:   I was in Miami for almost one month when I came for the draft process.  I think the city is great -- nice weather, perfect weather.  I met a lot of people there, really good people. So I like Miami, yeah.  The funny thing is, it's the first city I came to when I came to USA, so I think it's a perfect one. Q. In addition to obviously the skills you have on the court, one of the main things that's being talked about you is how similar your name is to Nikola Jokic.  Are you excited to play against him all? NIKOLA JOVIC:   I don't think we are that familiar.  I think our basketball IQ and passing, I think that's the two things that we can kind of compare.  Of course, he's doing it on another level.  And of course I'm looking forward.  I never met him before, so I'm looking forward to meet him and to play against him, it's going to be really good.\"}, 'Jaden Ivey': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=177703', 'text': \"Q. What are your emotions right now?  What are you feeling, and what's your advice to young players who one day want to get to the NBA? JADEN IVEY:   It's just a dream come true for me.  You know, I can remember sitting, a young boy, watching some of the great players get drafted.  I didn't want to stop until I was walking across that stage, shaking the commissioner's hand. It's just a dream come true. For all the kids that have dreams and aspirations, if they put their mind to it and they work hard, they can accomplish it. Q. What is it like knowing that your mom has been through this process?  How much of an impact does she have on your life now? JADEN IVEY:   It's actually an amazing story, to have a mother who has been in the league.  You don't see too many stories like that, and the bond that we have is special.  I thank her for all the things that she's done for me.  I know I wouldn't be on this stage, I wouldn't be here, without her. Q. You mentioned that you were a fan of Carsen Edwards growing up and now you're reunited with him, both Purdue guys, What does it mean to you? JADEN IVEY:   It means a lot.  I look up to Carsen.  He's one of the reasons why I came to Purdue, just to see how much he worked.  He's just a special talent.  I'm excited to join him. Q. Obviously you can't control any of this process but I was curious if you heard the same things we did, oh, the Knicks want to trade, every team wants to trade up for you.  Curious if that's the kind of thing you hear, your agents hear?  Are you able to zone that out?  Curious what goes through your mind in those 48 hours as we get close to this moment? JADEN IVEY:   My agents controlled all that. Q. Were you surprised, though? JADEN IVEY:   Yeah, they called me and just told me what was going on in the loop.  I didn't dictate anything.  So I'm just so blessed to be a Piston.  That's the way it played out and I'm looking forward to getting down there. Q. What was your mom's biggest advice? JADEN IVEY:   I think the biggest thing is if you want something in life, you have to work hard for it.  I've seen her work late nights, watching film, working hard to make herself better. I just learned that from her, and it's what got me here today. Q. What's the first thing you're going to buy with your NBA paycheck and who are you looking forward to playing against? JADEN IVEY:   Definitely a vehicle.  One of my favorite vehicles.  What was your other question? Q. Who are you looking forward to playing against? JADEN IVEY:   Playing against, definitely LeBron, someone that I looked up to and idolized.  Playing against him would be really great. Q. I know we talked to you about the Knicks, leading up to the draft, and even after you drafted, like Twitter was like, oh, the Knicks are still trying to get him.  Have you talked to the Pistons, like, hey, we're keeping you, don't worry about any of this other stuff? JADEN IVEY:   I mean, after the workout, it was a great workout and I really liked the organization.  I really had no clue where I was going to end up at.  When I heard my name called, it was crazy. Q. So at what age were you able to beat your mother one-on-one? JADEN IVEY:   That question comes up a lot.  I actually never really played my mom one-on-one.  She was a coach.  Her being a coach, I was trying to get all the help I can get, trying to learn new moves.  Anything I can get from her, I would ask her for. Q. Where does your game come to in the NBA?  Some have compared to you Westbrook.  Where do you think your game compares to an NBA player? JADEN IVEY:   Definitely Ja Morant, Russell Westbrook, guys that have the speed and athleticism.  I feel like I've been working on my mid-range a lot more this summer and I feel like I can showcase that as well.  Players like Michael Jordan and D-Wade.\"}, 'Chet Holmgren': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=177705', 'text': \"Q. Congratulations, dream came true today.  How does it feel to live this dream right now with all the emotion going through your mind? CHET HOLMGREN:   Yeah, it's a mix of emotions, probably a thousand emotions, all good ones.  You know, I don't really have words to describe them, but I'm so blessed and grateful to be able to be here.  I'm ready to compete.  I'm ready to go play. Q. What can you say about the dynamic of OKC and what you look to bring your rookie year? CHET HOLMGREN:   I think it's a great situation, great dynamic, playing with guys like Josh and Shai, as well as everybody down the roster.  It's a lot of great players there with unique skill sets.  I feel like I can kind of pair up with them and help enhance theirs as well as have their skill sets enhance mine. Q. What do you think you bring in an area now that there's more space, not as many zones?  How do you think your game translates to the NBA on both ends? CHET HOLMGREN:   On both ends.  I'll start on defense.  On defense, I can use my length and my quickness to cover a lot of ground and take up space.  There's more space to take up, obviously, but I feel like I can still take up a great deal of space on defense, both vertically and horizontally, sliding my feet as well as protecting the rim. And on offense, OKC plays a very five-out style of basketball.  There's a lot of space, especially in the paint to get to the basket or draw two defenders or drive and kick, find guys who are open.  Like you said, a lot more space, and it opens up. Q. What's the first thing you're going to buy with your NBA paycheck and who are you looking forward to playing against? CHET HOLMGREN:   I haven't really thought about that yet, as far as -- I'll probably end up buying a place to live.  That will probably be the first thing. But playing against, it will be special to share the court with Jalen (Suggs) again.  Obviously, we won't be wearing the same jersey, but to share the court with him would be special and to compete with him.  Again, even though we are not on the same team, it will be a great day. Q. I have to admit I didn't know that much about college basketball with the Draft, so I was reading a lot of mock drafts. Chet Holmgren, he's too thin, he's not ready for the NBA.  Do you read the mock drafts?  Is it the kind of thing where all the negative stuff you can easily put out, or is it motivation or do you ignore the whole thing? CHET HOLMGREN:   Yeah, I have a lot of motivations myself.  I'm very intrinsically motivated.  I wake up every day with a plan on how to make myself a better person, better basketball player.  I put so much effort into executing that, that it doesn't really leave room to put effort into things that, one, I can't control, and two, don't help make me better. I tune a lot of that stuff out.  I do see it here and there, but at the end of the day, I put no effort toward it. Q. I know I just asked you about the Thunder's rebuild, but how have you viewed that from an outside perspective and what have you thought about their process of compiling all of these picks and young talent like yourself? CHET HOLMGREN:   I think and what I saw, speaking to personnel in the organization, and on my visit, they have a great organization as well as a great vision going forward.  I'd say compiling the draft picks and all that is part of vision.  Taking it one step at a time is important, especially for myself. You know, over time, that vision should pay off. Q. Did you have an expectation of what would happen today when you woke up this morning?  Did it go as planned from getting here to hearing your name called, the whole day and night? CHET HOLMGREN:   Yeah, I try to live with as few expectations as possible, so I can just completely be in the moment.  That's one of the biggest things that I've tried to do today and one of the biggest pieces of advice I've gotten from many different people.  Stay in the moment, soak it all in because it goes quick, and you can't relive it. I've been 100 percent in the moment going with the flow today, and look where we are. Q. How did it feel going from Gonzaga to right here now, and what are you most looking forward to over the next few months? CHET HOLMGREN:   It's definitely crazy.  The lights don't get much brighter than this.  You know, coming from a smaller place like Spokane and Gonzaga.  But it reminds me, like the Oklahoma fan base and community, it me reminds me a lot of Gonzaga, our community.  Super rowdy fans that are diehard for their organization.  I'm proud to represent them. Q. I'm interested in your fashion sense.  NBA Draft is usually when everyone kind of goes all-out with their outfits.  How did you decide what to wear?  And another question is which NBA player's fashion sense do you appreciate or like? CHET HOLMGREN:   I definitely appreciate my new teammate Shai.  He's got the drip, for sure. We were just talking about over there how much competition I have now on the NBA tunnel walk-throughs.  So it should be great.\"}, 'AJ Griffin': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=177714', 'text': \"Q.

Just to know where you're going and to be able to play for the Hawks, I mean, it's an honor.  I'm ready to get to the plane and work.  I'm excited right now. Q.

So how good do you feel about that? AJ GRIFFIN:   I feel amazed.  You know, just grateful to be able to be in the right spot.  I'm just ready to get to work and play with a guy, Trae, I looked up to, just watching him play throughout the years.  It's a surreal feeling. Q. Did you think the Knicks might take you at 11?  A New York guy, were you hoping for that? AJ GRIFFIN:   I was really just waiting for my name no matter who it was.  Just to be able to be in the Draft, I was more than excited.  I'm ready to go to ATL. Q. You walked up with your brother and sister, and I know you have a great basketball family.  Can you tell me how growing up with a basketball family helped you get to this point? AJ GRIFFIN:   Yeah, that moment is special.  Just to be able to share that with my siblings -- growing up, we used to play one-on-one all the time and just dreamed about that moment.  I think it's a memory I'm going to remember forever, and I'm sure they will, too. Q. I know there were a lot of Stepinac guys in the crowd tonight, your high school coach.  How special is that?  They obviously look up to you, just like you looked up to your brother and some of the other players when you were a young Crusader. AJ GRIFFIN:   That's special, man, to have my coach there and to just feel the love from the community.  I'm about to go get dinner with them.  I just can't wait to say what's up and just enjoy this night with them. Q. What advice did your dad give to you be in this moment right now? AJ GRIFFIN:   Man, he gave me so much advice.  Just to be here today and just to share this moment with him, he just always told me the truth, always gave me the best advice a father could.  I'm just truly grateful and blessed to be able to have a father like him.  I'm just excited to see -- trying to get that first win against him.

During the Combine, you spoke about a confidence about you being able to guard one through five.  Where does that confidence come from?  Because we saw it on display, not just in the words you were saying.  Was it LSU or before that? TARI EASON:   It really just stems from my competitive nature.  I believe that no one can score on me, or not, or I make it hard for people to score on me.  I know it's the NBA and certain dudes are going to score and things are going to happen.  But I pride myself on my defense and really just my competitive spirit always. Q.

JALEN DUREN:   I'm just happy to even get the opportunity, being blessed enough to be in the NBA.  Not everybody gets the opportunity, so the fact that I'm here is good for me.

I mean, it's always nice to stay where I'm comfortable at in college, but I just think the opportunity that I have now and that I was given due to the way I played this past year, I don't think there was any chance I could have stayed. Q. What's the first thing you're going to buy with an NBA paycheck, and who are you looking forward to playing against? JOHNNY DAVIS:   I'll probably buy a car with my first paycheck.

I love the culture they've built there.  And being able to hopefully play in the World Cup and the Olympics coming up, that would be a dream come true for me, just like tonight was getting drafted. Q. New Orleans has a lot of young talent.  How do you see yourself fitting in and where do you feel like you're going to contribute? DYSON DANIELS:   I think with me there's so many different roles that I can play on a team, that I contribute in so many different ways.  Especially on the defensive end, that's where I like to bring it.  I can defend multiple positions, guard the ball and even go down and guard the post sometimes.  With the ball in my hands, I can play-make, play without the ball, be a cutter, rebound and stuff like that.  I feel like my game is very versatile and I could fit into a lot of different lineups with the great players that we have on this team. Q. Just wanted to know who are you looking most forward to playing, someone you've looked up to or just know? DYSON DANIELS:   It's the NBA now, so everyone, really.  It would be cool to play against my boy Josh Giddey.  It would be cool to play against LeBron James and Russell Westbrook, who I idolized growing up. I'm just so happy to be a Pelican and I can't wait to get to work. Q. How do you feel like your experience with the G League Ignite helped you? DYSON DANIELS:   The G League was huge for me. Playing against the NBA style of play, playing against NBA-type players,  I had to learn how to play faster, more physical.  Know when I could get mine.  We had a great team and we had really good veterans and a really good coaching staff.  I learned a lot throughout my year, and I think I improved as the year went on.  The G League was definitely a really good step for me and helped me get here, for sure. Q. So what's the first thing you're going to buy with your NBA paycheck, and who are you looking forward to playing against? DYSON DANIELS:   First thing I'm going to buy, I'm going to need a car.  So I'm going to have to get a nice car.  I'm a big car guy, so that would be one thing. But I'm sure Mom and Dad will get some as well. Who am I looking forward to playing?  I think Josh Giddey.  He's definitely the main one.  In Australia, head-to-head, we used to go one-on-one back when we played in the NBA Academy together. Definitely him.  And LeBron and Westbrook, as well.  That would be cool to play against them. Q. It's not normal for a team picking in the top 10 to just come off a playoff fun.  How excited are you to get in it and be in a situation where they are already geared toward winning? DYSON DANIELS:   Yeah, I think that's huge.  They made a really big step last year in making the playoffs, and did well in the playoffs, too. So I think being able to join this team, I think I can help them go further in the playoffs.  And for me, I'm a winner.  I love to win games.  I hate losing.  So I'm going to do whatever the team needs to help them win.  I think I can definitely step into some roles and contribute straightaway. Q. Did you have any expectations coming into today and to the draft, and if you did, did it go as you suspected? DYSON DANIELS:   I worked out with the teams from like 5 to 11, so I was thinking somewhere in that range. But I'm just so happy I've landed in New Orleans. They have a great coaching staff, great players.  I loved it when I went there for the workout. I didn't really have an idea.  My agent kept everything quiet, so it was a surprise to me.  I'm so happy to be here.\"}, 'Max Christie': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=177724', 'text': \"Q. How does it feel to finally be a part of the NBA after such a long process? MAX CHRISTIE:   It feels really, really good just to have my dream come true.  I'm really living my dream, so it feels really, really good.  That's the only thing I can sum up.  I have a lot of emotions right now. Q. You're joining one of the most well-known teams in the NBA, teaming up with LeBron James and Anthony Davis.  How do you feel about a chance to do that? MAX CHRISTIE:   It's amazing.  It's surreal. LeBron James, Anthony Davis, Russell Westbrook, Carmelo Anthony -- the list goes on.  A bunch of great names, a bunch of great players on the Lakers team.  I think I can learn a lot and get a lot better in that organization. Q. Do you have a player in particular that you're excited to learn from?  They have a lot of veterans you just listed. MAX CHRISTIE:   I think Carmelo Anthony is a pretty good example, someone I can pick his brain.  He's one of the greatest scorers of all time.  I know he's a great player historically and he's a great player now, so he's someone I'll be looking to, for sure. Q. Obviously a lot of pressure with any team, and with LeBron, the pressure to win now.  Do you feel like you're ready to join a win-now environment and contribute to a hopeful championship pursuit? MAX CHRISTIE:   Yeah, definitely.  I think I'm ready to contribute, for sure, right away.  I'm just happy to be part of the organization and contribute any way I can.\"}, 'Kendall Brown': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=177729', 'text': \"Q. Getting drafted after such a long draft process, how does it feel to have all your hard work pay off? KENDALL BROWN:   It feels great.  It's just a relief to be able to be drafted to the NBA and just have the opportunity to show what I can do. Q. I believe you're heading to the Pacers.  How excited are you to team up with Bennedict and Ty Haliburton? KENDALL BROWN:   It's going to be great.  Me and Bennedict, we were training out there together, as well.  So it's going to be cool out there, and just can't wait to get started. Q. What's the No. 1 skill on the court that you're going to look to bring to the Pacers to get them back to being a winning team? KENDALL BROWN:   I would just say my IQ and my athleticism.\"}, 'Christian Braun': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=177718', 'text': \"Q. Coming off a national championship win, with the experiences that you had in that run, what lessons are you going to take from that that you're going to bring to the NBA? CHRISTIAN BRAUN:   Yeah, the run was great, obviously.  All the guys, it was amazing to see Ochai go tonight. Just lessons I would take, Coach told me before, if you're going to try, the process to go, go two feet in.  That's something I would say I took from this process and the championship game.  It was an amazing moment for us.\"}, 'Malaki Branham': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=177723', 'text': \"Q. Who is a player on the Spurs that you admire? MALAKI BRANHAM:   I'd probably say Dejounte Murray, just because he was kind of in the same range that I was, and also just hard worker and he's a great defensive player. Q. What's the funniest or scariest rumor you've heard about being a rookie? MALAKI BRANHAM:   There's a lot of rookie duties, and if you don't do them, you might like pay consequences for them.  So I'm going to do all my rookie duties. Q. First of all, congratulations.  What is it about the Spurs that you think you would be a good fit with them? MALAKI BRANHAM:   Yeah, I feel like just me spacing the floor and me being able to knock down outside shots, I feel like I'm a good fit for that. Q. And ahead of the Draft, did you work out with them, interview with them? MALAKI BRANHAM:   I worked out with them. Q. How did it go? MALAKI BRANHAM:   It went good.  We had a couple Lottery guys, first-round guys in there, and it went good. Q. What Spurs player are you looking forward to playing against in practice? MALAKI BRANHAM:   Really, all of them.  We're going to compete and that's going to be good.  We're always going to compete. Q. I've been hearing stories about your work ethic.  How long has it been a part of what you do and how important do you think that has been to your journey here? MALAKI BRANHAM:   Yeah, my work ethic started probably like sixth or seventh grade.  That's when I really took it serious.  It got me here.  I'm just blessed. Q. Every photo I see of you, you're smiling.  What are things that make you smile on the basketball court and off the basketball court? MALAKI BRANHAM:   On the basketball court, I'm just having fun.  If you're not having fun, why are you doing it?  So me having fun. Also off the court, I'm a smiley, laughy kind of person once you get to know me.  I'd say that's why I'm smiling a lot. Q. There's been three Spurs first-round picks so far between you, Jeremy Sochan and Blake Wesley from Notre Dame.  Do you have relationship with those guys? MALAKI BRANHAM:   Yeah, so actually Blake Wesley was in my workout with the Spurs.  So I've played against him.  But also Jeremy Sochan.  I feel like those two guys, I've built a relationship just throughout this pre-draft process.  It's definitely going to be good.  Our relationship is going to be a lot closer, for sure. Q. Have you spent time in Texas at all? MALAKI BRANHAM:   No, not really.  Yeah, not really. Q. Are you excited to try some breakfast tacos? MALAKI BRANHAM:   I am, actually.  I love breakfast food, so I'm open to try some breakfast tacos.\"}, 'MarJon Beauchamp': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=177722', 'text': \"Q. Not only did you make it to the NBA, but you're going to the team that won the championship two years ago.  How excited are you to play with the Giannis? MARJON BEAUCHAMP:   I'm so excited.  Playing against one of the greatest to play the game and a great team, to learn from them and to learn from Khris Middleton and all the vets they have, it's amazing.  And I feel like God put me in this position to grow and to become one of them. So that's my plan, just to learn and keep growing. Q. What's the first thing you're going to buy with your NBA paycheck, and who are you looking forward to playing against? MARJON BEAUCHAMP:   My first paycheck, it's always been a dream of mine to buy my mom a house.  So I want to give my mom a house. And who I look forward to playing against is LeBron, my favorite player.  I can't wait to play against him. Q. Obviously we know that you took a very unique route of going with the G League Ignite team.  Can you tell us about how that prepared you not only for today but your experience in the NBA and moving forward? MARJON BEAUCHAMP:   Yeah, the NBA G League Ignite, I feel like I found myself.  I found new ways in my game, not just on the court but just off the court. Building good habits and really, just like I said, finding a defensive motor and learning the defensive terminology.  I would give that advice to any kid that wants to go be a pro.  I feel like I'm a step ahead of people coming in. Q. Hearing your name called, what was going through your mind to hear that you finally achieved that dream after talking about it so much this past year? MARJON BEAUCHAMP:   Yeah, man, a lot was going through my head.  I feel like I was going through all the phases I've been through.  Going through my head, just everything I had to sacrifice to be here today. And, man, I'm just blessed to be here.  I'm just ready to grow and become a great basketball player and just keep working, because that's all I do.  I work.  I can't wait to get to this new city.\"}, 'Paolo Banchero': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=177701', 'text': 'Q. What will you bring to Orlando? PAOLO BANCHERO:   Man, I plan on bringing everything I have to Orlando.  First off, just a winning mindset, a work-first mindset.  Just ready to get in with the guys and get to work. This is one of the best moments of my life.  I\\'m super excited.  I couldn\\'t be happier to be a member of the Orlando Magic. Q. Paolo, how much of a dream come true is this to be a No. 1 overall draft pick in the NBA, and also, how do you feel you\\'ll fit in with the Orlando Magic? PAOLO BANCHERO:   No, this isn\\'t even a dream.  I feel like this is a fantasy.  I dreamed of being in the NBA, but being the No. 1 overall pick, this is crazy. What was the second part? Q. How you feel you\\'ll fit in. PAOLO BANCHERO:   I feel like I\\'ll fit in great.  The Magic, they have a lot of talent.  They\\'re very deep.  They also have a lot of dynamic forwards like myself with Wendell, Franz Wagner.  Adding myself, I feel like that\\'s going to give teams a lot of problems. That\\'s three 6\\'9\", 6\\'10\", 6\\'11\" guys who can dribble, pass and shoot, have high IQ.  I think that\\'s going to be a huge advantage for us and a struggle for other teams to game plan for. Q. We saw some tears up there.  What are you feeling right now?  What did it take?  And what\\'s your advice to all the young players that one day want to be on that stage? PAOLO BANCHERO:   Yeah, you know, it was a very emotional moment.  I\\'ve never cried tears of joy in my life, and I was telling everyone I wasn\\'t going to cry no matter what pick I was picked.  It just hit me.  I couldn\\'t stop it. But any advice I would give is just take it day by day.  Don\\'t look too far ahead, don\\'t look too far in the future and focus on what\\'s in front of you day in, day out.  Just work hard and stack days together, and it\\'s going to pay off. Q. What are you wearing?  You told me you were wearing Dolce and Niemen\\'s.  Is that Dolce Gabbana? PAOLO BANCHERO:   Yeah, provided by Niemen\\'s and Dolce. Q. When did you know you were actually going to be drafted by Orlando, and did you have a feeling during the day that things were kind of changing and you were going to be the first pick? PAOLO BANCHERO:   I had a feeling from the information I was being told is that it was just kind of up in the air.  Orlando wasn\\'t really sure yet, and just to be ready for whatever. I didn\\'t find out, though, that I was actually getting picked until about 20 seconds before the commissioner got on the stage.  I didn\\'t even have time to really think about it or anything.  It just kind of happened.  I can\\'t believe it, but I\\'m ready.  I\\'m ready. Q. What\\'s the first thing you\\'re going to buy with your official NBA paycheck, and who are you looking forward to playing against? PAOLO BANCHERO:   First thing I\\'m going to buy with my paycheck?  Probably a car, nice car, or somewhere nice to stay. Second question was who am I looking forward to playing against?  Really anybody.  I\\'m just looking forward to playing in the NBA.  That\\'s the best competition in the world.  Every game is a challenge.  I\\'m really looking forward to just competing night in, night out. Q. Can you reflect on your journey from shadow watching your mother and your cousin Chris win a state championship and your mother playing professional basketball?  Can you reflect on the people who paved the way for you? PAOLO BANCHERO:   Yeah, it\\'s been a long journey, growing up in Seattle and, like you said, just being around my mom, always in the gym, watching Chris.  They taught me a lot, especially my mother.  She stayed on me, always held me accountable and made sure I was on the right track. I just developed a real strong work ethic at a young age and continued it on through my high school and college days.  I was also blessed by God with height and the physique that he gave me, and I just reflected on it.  It\\'s crazy that this is happening right now.  It just is a once-in-a-lifetime experience that I\\'ll never be able to forget. Q. We talked about money. No state income tax in Florida. I\\'m sure your representatives must be pretty happy about that.  Can you tell us what it was like to choose a representative?  Are you prepared to handle that money?  I was wondering how the business side of that came together for you. PAOLO BANCHERO:   Yeah, well, luckily both my parents are very educated and very smart with their money, so they\\'ve taught me to do the same.  I\\'ll definitely be smart with it and treat it the right way, use it for the right things. Q. Have past Duke players reached out to you like Kyrie Irving, Jayson Tatum? PAOLO BANCHERO:   I haven\\'t had my phone on me the whole time, but I\\'m sure that I have a couple texts waiting in my phone.  I\\'ve got a pretty good relationship with Jayson, Zion, Kyrie -- all those guys I\\'ve met and talked to.  I\\'m sure they\\'ll have something, some words of encouragement. Q. I wanted to ask you, one year at Duke, how did your working with Coach K and his staff prepare you to make the jump to the NBA? PAOLO BANCHERO:   Yeah, I feel like they really, really prepared me as best as anyone could.  I was a good player when I came in, but I think they really took me to another level and helped transform me as a player. They helped me with a lot of things, helped improve my game in a lot of ways.  Coach K, especially on and off the court, he\\'s a great, great advice giver, great leader and he\\'s the greatest of all time. Every day he was really giving us new gems, new pieces of advice that we could take on forever.  So I thank him.  I thank Duke.  I\\'m always going to be a part of the brotherhood and the Duke basketball family. Q. Italy produced another Italian first pick overall with Andrea Bargnani.  Can we actually say that we produced another with you? PAOLO BANCHERO:   I don\\'t know if that would be fair to Bargnani.  Bargnani is born and raised in Italy.  I\\'m born and raised in Seattle, Washington.  I don\\'t want to take anything away from him, but I\\'m definitely proud to have Italian roots and being able to represent Italy, for sure.'}, 'Ochai Agbaji': {'link': 'http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=177716', 'text': \"Q.

What was it like to sit there and wait and even guys coming out of the stands picked and going to the stage? SKAL LABISSIERE: It was tough at first, but one thing about the league, one thing about all of us now, everything starts over for all of us.  We all start over once we get to that level.  I'm excited to get to work.  I know I have a bright future ahead of me. Q. And you said yesterday that you thought maybe five years from now you could be considered the best player in the draft.  How much did this experience maybe shape that belief? SKAL LABISSIERE: I still believe it.  I'm about to go to work, so I'm going to control what I can control. Q. Sacramento was a team that had expressed a lot of interest in you.  The idea of being in Sacramento with DeMarcus, another Kentucky guy, how do you think the fit is? SKAL LABISSIERE: I think it's going to be a good fit learning from DeMarcus Cousins, Willie Cauley-Stein is there and I know him pretty well.  Rajon Rondo, who's a really good point guard.  I think they're going to help me a lot. Q. Does it take some of the pressure off that you've got all of those guys around you and you can go and be you? SKAL LABISSIERE: I think so, guys I like to talk to.  Like Coach Cal told me when I got drafted, those guys are your brothers now.  I'm looking forward to being around them and learning from them. Q. There was obviously some sort of frustrating moments there at the table.  Everybody at your table looked kind of down at different points and I know Cal did even at some points but he kept looking across the table and encouraging you.  What was he saying to you? SKAL LABISSIERE: Just that, \"You're good.  You're going to be fine.  You should use that as fuel to get better.\"  He told me how good I was. Q. Did you enter into today thinking this might be a possibility, that there might be an opportunity for this to happen?  Did you prepare for that, or is this sort of something that just caught you by surprise? SKAL LABISSIERE: I was prepared for anything.  Anything could happen.  I could have got picked earlier and got traded to somewhere else.  But everything happens for a reason.  I firmly believe that. Q. Now that you've come into a situation as you've discussed, where there's a healthy amount of bigs on that roster, where do you focus on trying to make your impact?  What can you bring to the table Day 1 that might help you carve out your niche? SKAL LABISSIERE: My versatility.  I'm very versatile.  I can do a lot of different things on both ends of the floor, and I'm ready to go to work.  So I'm not going to shy away from it. Q. What do you think is going to be your biggest challenge in Sacramento?  You're going to have someone like DeMarcus Cousins and other people to play with and learn from, so what will be the biggest learning experience? SKAL LABISSIERE: The biggest learning experience, I think that will be for every rookie, getting used to the speed of the game, the physicality of the game.  I'm going to work really hard to put weight on, get stronger.  That won't be a problem for me.  Those two things I would say. Q. What do you know about Sacramento the city and the area? SKAL LABISSIERE: I've never been there, so I'm about to find out soon.\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["raw_word_dict = text_to_count(new, \"text\")\n","new = count_common_occurance(new,

Andr, if you can start with some opening comments about being drafted by the piss sons.  ANDR DRUMMOND: Speechless, really. It's a great opportunity for me. It's a dream come true, growing up as a little kid hearing my name being called and shaking David Stern's hand. I just feel great.   Q. Talk about how you're looking forward to play with good, young players like Brandon Knight and how you'll grow together?  ANDR DRUMMOND: I know we'll build a great team chemistry right away. It's a great organization and the fans are great up there. I just can't wait to be a part of the team.   Q. Do you see yourself as the center on the team or is Greg Monroe the center?  ANDR DRUMMOND: I see myself wherever coach puts me is wherever I'm going to work my hardest at.  Q. Not sure how much you even paid attention to all of the talk this week or what your agent was telling you all week. Is this now just a sense of relief and pretty emotional?  ANDR DRUMMOND: Yeah, I mean, I talked to Detroit; I actually worked out with them the day before the Draft actually and they told me they liked me a lot and if I was still there, they would definitely take me. The 8th pick went by and they were right up, and I just broke down in tears because I knew I was going to get called next.   Q. You said Detroit worked you out the day before and others have said the teams didn't work them out at all. Is there any rhyme or reason on this? Trying to figure out if the workouts mean anything? ANDR DRUMMOND: Every work out means everything because you need to go out there and showcase yourself to a team. Sometimes you might not be a position they are looking for but it's always good to take a look at you. Every workout means something to me and I'm sure it means a lot to every other player that went to workouts, as well.   Q. Talk about what's the one thing you feel that you have to address quickly as you arrive in the NBA?  ANDR DRUMMOND: With the help of my teammates, lift the organization and the family out there; all the talk about my not playing hard is going to be put to rest immediately. I'll have my teammates who are my brothers now to push me and I'll put that to rest and the rest of the game is going to be great because they have a great coaching staff out there, as well he's going to help me rebound; rebound, box out.  Q. How long do you think you need to make an impact in the NBA? You're young, obviously, do we have to be patient with you a little bit? ANDR DRUMMOND: I think I'm not going to try to force anything too fast. Just do whatever Coach tells me to do and wherever he puts me is where I'm going to play and I'm going to work my hardest and I'm going to give it my all every single day.  I think when I do come in, I can definitely make an impact on defense, run the floor really well and grab rebounds and block shots.  Offensively is what they are going to work on me with, and it's definitely going to come to me.   Q. You were very emotional on the stage; what was going through your mind at that point?  ANDR DRUMMOND: It's just a sign of relief. My mom was holding my hand throughout the whole Draft and she was like, we're here, be patient, your name is going to be called soon. As soon as Toronto went by and Detroit came up, I started breaking down because I thought about all of the years I worked hard and all of the struggles I went through playing basketball; just everything I went through, and just being here today, hearing my name being called is the greatest thing in the world.  Q. Did you expect to go sooner?  ANDR DRUMMOND: I didn't look at myself as being a top pick or anything like that. I just looked at it wherever I was going to go I was going to work my hardest, doesn't matter wherever you go, one, two, three, four, five on the list; whenever I go, I'm going to work my hardest.   Q. On a lighter note, are you looking forward to competing in the Dunk Contest?  ANDR DRUMMOND: Absolutely. Definitely I'm going to compete in the Dunk Contest (smiling).

I definitely think that's going to be a guy that I lean on early in my career.  That's a great resource that we already have, especially since we already have a relationship.    Q.  It's a young team you're going to Jameer Nelson, Darko; talk about this youth movement, it certainly sounds like a great future?   J.J. REDICK:  Yeah, that's one of the reasons I wanted to go to Orlando was because they had Jameer Nelson and Dwight Howard and Darko.  I feel like as those guys improve and become bonafide superstars in this league, that will only help my game and my improvement.
